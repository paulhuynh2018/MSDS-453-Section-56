Canadian director Denis Villeneuve made one great film in 2013 called Prisoners. Provocative, enthralling and beautifully composed, it peeled away the layers of a complex mystery story with a surprise in every frame. I was an instant fan. This promising relationship has come to a heartbreaking finale with every film since. Enemy and Sicario were unspeakable disasters, and Arrival, the directors latest exercise in pretentious poopery, gives me every reason to believe I have parted company with Denis Villeneuve for good.
TV anchormen on every channel pour out the news that 12 unidentified flying saucers have landed throughout the world, in places as far afield as Russia, Venezuela and Montana. Borders are closed (dont tell Donald Trump), gas is in such limited supply that theres no way to escape, and the president declares a state of emergency. Enter Amy Adams, as linguistics professor Dr. Louise Banks, and Jeremy Renner, as theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly, recruited by the U.S. military to find out what the aliens want, decipher their language through translation and ask them what their goals are. Never mind that Jodie Foster already solved the problem years ago, in Contact. Adams is more neurotic and short-fused, still grieving over the disappearance of her husband and the loss of her daughter from some inexplicable disease that may or may not have traveled from outer space. (I think it was cancer, but with this movie, cancer seems too logical, and who can tell?) Anyway, the spaceship she finds is an obelisk-shaped rock suspended above the ground, and the aliens inside it look like the grab-ass trees that threw apples at Judy Garland in Oz.
The extraterrestrial quantum leap that follows takes almost two hours to unravel, and then nothing happens that makes one bit of sense. Adapted by Eric Heisserer from a bizarre story by sci-fi poseur Ted Chiang, Arrival is a weird flick, slow and tedious, too metaphysical for Rod Serlings The Twilight Zone and most likely to appeal to people who like to play video games and solve puzzles. One reviewer at last years Venice Film Festival, where this head scratcher was unveiled, praised the film for details of linguistic research and mathematical probability equations instead of the smash and grab of space conflicts in your typical sci-fi lunacies. Sorry, but Im one of those folks who prefers a little smash and grab, myself.
Since nothing ever happens, Dr. Banks pronounces the aliens friendly and surmises that the news they want to share is about the future of the planet. Nobody believes her, so the alien ships finally withdraw. Language, they insist, is the only thing that links the species to the future of humanity. Unfortunately, the aliens dont really do anything but squeal like babies with colic, and theres nothing linear about their language, so theres nothing linear about the movie, either. Result: There is no beginning, no middle and no end. This might be O.K. for a language, but a movie has to start and end somewhere. Also, shes lost a child. But in the end, you realize the present is the future and the future is the past, or something. So the child Adams lost hasnt been born yet, and Renner, the new astrophysicist she falls for on a tour of the space ship, is going to be the lover she lost years ago, ready to father the baby, who will be called Hannah because the name is a palindrome. If you got all that, write it on a postcard and mail it to somebody who cares. I couldnt wait to call Arrival by the new name Departure.

Denis Villeneuves Arrival begins with a premise weve seen in a hundred summer blockbusters. One day, aliens arrive on Earth, in the form of twelve mysterious ships scattered around the globe. Their purpose is unclear, and humanity is naturally both intrigued and terrified. Where it goes next, though, is a welcome return to grown-up sci-fi, more Contact or Interstellar than Independence Day.
For starters, the aliens dont open with an attack. And we Earthlings dont, either. Instead, the U.S. military calls upon Louise (Amy Adams), a linguistics professor, to try and make contact with the alien spaceship in Montana. From there, Villeneuve carefully unspools a story thats equal parts heart and intellect, encompassing memory, language, loss, love, grief, and the passage of time.
Louise is a withdrawn and serious sort, not much given to smiling or joking. Perhaps her reserve is explained by the opening scene of the movie, an extended memory montage that shows Louise having and raising a baby girl, and then losing her to illness. I used to think this was the beginning of your story, Adams Louise says at the beginning of the sequence, but memory doesnt work like that. Prickly though she may be, Louise is brilliant in her given field. When the aliens begin to speak in their language, Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) brings her on board, along with a theoretical physicist named Ian (Jeremy Renner). And as Louise begins working toward an understanding with the aliens, she finds that the work is affecting her in ways she cant understand, control, or predict.
Adams has been nominated for the Oscar five times in the past decade, and Arrival is an effective reminder of why that is. She commands the screen effortlessly, even when she doesnt appear to be doing much of anything, and she embodies Louise so wholly its easy to forget weve seen her in dozens of other roles before. Louise isnt an especially showy performance  it doesnt involve tics or prosthetics or the kind of ostentatious outbursts that attract awards attention  but like so many others on Adams resume, its quietly a great one.
Everything about Arrival feels meticulously crafted, from the gorgeously composed shots (you could probably freeze just about any moment in this movie and come away with a stunning still) to the Jhann Jhannsson score. Like Sicario, Arrival uses its soundscape to draw you into the movie. When Louise dons a radiation suit for her first meeting with the heptapods (as they call the aliens), I could practically feel the humidity through the sound of her breathing. The aliens spoken language is a rumble almost more felt than heard. Combined with his resolute commitment to keeping Arrival grounded  this really is a world just like ours, except with aliens  Arrival starts to seem like an experience were having, not just a movie were watching.
Its hard to say too much more about Arrival without digging into spoiler territory, so Ill just leave you with this: Arrival hit me where I live. Its true concern is nothing so trivial as extraterrestrial life, but questions like how we understand the world, how we remember our own stories, why we allow ourselves to suffer, and what we get in return. Its brainy sci-fi with a big, bloody, beating heart.

After screening at Telluride earlier this year, critics have hailed Arrival as a game-changer for director Denis Villeneuve. But where is this change specifically? With the esoteric science fiction of Villeneuves Enemy and a female lead akin to Sicario, Villeneuves marriage of sci-fi and action drama is the revelation. Arrival couldnt have arrived (pun intended) at a better time and the films message of international cooperation sticks out more than anything else.
When twelve mysterious alien pods station themselves throughout the world, questions understandably arise. Doctor Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a linguist, is recruited by the U.S. government to interview the alien beings in the hopes of discovering what they want.
Arrival reinstilled my interest in Villeneuve as a director after being in the minority on last years Sicario. The film suffers from issues in the presentation of Louises character, but its less irksome than Emily Blunt in the former film. DP Bradford Young frames Adams against the ships ethereal structure and their similarities to Louises own sparse life beautifully. Youngs photographic compositions continue to cement him as a promising young talent.
Past and futures intersection, coupled with Louise and Ians (Jeremy Renner) present day mission are like watching a waking dream. This leaves more of a lingering fascination for the aesthetic, as opposed to feeling the story. You have to admire the films beauty in its questions rather than live in the present matter of what its saying.
With the election results tensions are running high, Arrivals message is whats important. Eric Heisserers script takes a thoughtful approach to first contact, showing a divided world with China and Russias wariness turning dangerous. Eerily enough Louises pleads for international cooperation are so prescient today as to be prophecy; television news broadcasts show the fear and apprehension of the aliens arrival that produce chills in a post-election world.
A key portion of Heisserers script is devoted to linguistics and language, with obvious parallels to Jodie Fosters Contact.  Linguistically dense, audiences might be turned off by the films user-manual technical jargon. But with so many action films leaning towards anti-intellectualism, how Arrival embraces knowledge is refreshing.
How language becomes misrepresented couldnt be timelier, and Heisserer believes his audience will get the message, eventually. Adams describes the world of language in a straightforward way that flows as smoothly as the alien language itself. Adams breaking down a sentence to its basic parts is one of my favorite scenes of the year; its the English major in me. (Itll be interesting to put this alongside Alex Garlands Annihilation next years, a similar sci-fi tale with living prose.)
Adams is a firecracker as Louise. Her massive intelligence has kept her at a distance from the world, yet she never apologizes. Her performance is quiet and methodical. When the government refuses to listen, she recounts a story about the origins of the word kangaroo in one of the films few moments of intellectual humor. Jeremy Renner plays second fiddle to Adams (which works out just fine). He doesnt do anything wow-worthy, but that could be because Adams is such a powerhouse.
However, for all Arrivals good its payload, the human component, becomes a sappy quagmire. The time conceit is apparent from the moment Adams declares we are so bound by time. Though the films twist presents itself nicely, her statements keep the audience on edge. This opens the door for an abundance of deus ex machinas. Certain third act moments come from the writers penciling themselves into a corner with the erase button too close at hand.
Renners Ian is a product of this convenience, acting as Louises scientific partner spouting exposition. He situates them as opposites  he sees science as the foundation for civilization; she thinks language is  but theres no real conflict between the two. By the end hes there to service the twist and perpetuate the equation that two people of opposite genders working together must always end up together by the end.
Though beautifully shot, with a phenomenal performance by Amy Adams it doesnt set aside how plodding the narrative feels, how perfunctory the supporting cast is, and how the twist does little more than remind us of staid tropes weve seen before. Arrival is a necessary film in these trying times. Its message about cooperation and the ease for miscommunication couldnt be needed more. But unlike my colleagues praising this as the second coming, I just didnt see it.

Arrival reframes the story of Louise Banks, a linguist who learns to see the future after decoding the palindromic language of aliens hovering in the earths atmosphere. On a professional level, her premonitions prevent a third World War. Louise was hired by the US government to communicate with the extraterrestrial beings  a conventional science-fiction premise she subverts by understanding that its the humans, and not the mysterious aliens, who must be stopped from destroying their own planet. But on a personal level, Louises recurring flashbacks  of a daughter she lost to an incurable disease  are in fact revealed to be premonitions of her own life. She has been seeing memories of her future all along.
This revelation makes for one of the great closings in modern cinema: a brooding montage of shots and thoughts, scored to Max Richters haunting On The Nature Of Daylight and marked by perhaps the most visceral voiceover of our times. The gist is that despite knowing the journey, and where it leads, I embrace it, and welcome every moment of it. Louise becomes aware that a numbing tragedy awaits her, and she still decides to pursue this path. She chooses to experience destiny rather than deflect it, even at the cost of incurring the pain and wrath of her beloved.
Imagine a profound relationship drama about a couple who rear a child only for the man to discover that his wife led him towards their doomed fate despite knowing the outcome. But the enduring genius of Arrival is that this is not the film we see. What we see is essentially the past  the memories of this more direct and implied film  told through a public event that sets a private future into motion. Its a narrative sleight of hand that is virtually unfilmable. Yet, director Denis Villeneuve creates his own distinct visual language, whose emotional immediacy is tailored to fit its literary source, Ted Chiangs sci-fi novella Story Of Your Life. This in turn transforms the discerning viewer into a linguist of sorts, immersed in the interpretation of intent.
More importantly its also an existential sleight of hand  one that has, in the last year, acquired a prophetic identity by transcending the confines of storytelling. True to its theme, Arrival itself seems like a premonition of a more tangible event. In Louise Bankss challenge lie the echoes of a more recent crisis. In many ways, the 2016 release is the consummate pandemic film. Its not so much the eerie politics of the premise, which incidentally features China as the nation withholding information in the face of mass destruction. Instead, the link is more individualistic  it has more to do with the resolution of the human mind than the conflict of humanity. It has more to do with the personality of change than the plurality of progress. Arrival uncovered a culture of healing almost four years before the world began bleeding.
Up until 2020, most of us evolved with a perpetual fear of consequence. We progressed with the persistent urge to confront, and control, the linearity of time. There were ambitions, goals, destinations, achievements and all the absolute things that defied the spontaneity of a future. We starred in our own relationship dramas, romantic comedies, dysfunctional family films, Shakespearean tragedies and cerebral thrillers. We headlined visible stories, films that were seen rather than implied, defined by our tussles with destiny. Everything we did was aimed at forecasting  and shaping  a sense of forwardness in order to reverse-engineer the present to reach there. Everything we planned was bereft of a sense of mortality; we moved at the pace of a forever, as though death were only a theoretical construct waiting for the end of every story.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been cripplingly public and physical, but its long-term legacy is psychological. The arrival of the virus has done the work of 12 ominous spacecraft. On one hand, it has forced disparate people and nations to collaborate and unite to decipher the unknown. On the other, the global lockdown has become the definitive event of every life  a shared film that has set countless private futures into tangential motion. Its become clear that the palindromic language of the pandemic is grief, which in turn has altered our linear perception of time. Now, not unlike Louise Banks, we are acutely aware of human mortality. We sense that death is real, tangible and close; it is an end that waits for no story. And yet, despite recognising the inevitability of tragedy, despite finally knowing that our years will amount to nothing, millions have chosen to follow fate. Millions have decided to embrace  and deeply feel  the journey. Millions have chosen to combine the certainty of living with the uncertainty of life.
Weve had babies. Weve moved to beaches and mountains. Weve broken geographical shackles. Weve woken at sunrise. Weve moved in with partners and parents. Weve bought that new cycle. Weve seen that old waterfall. Weve applied to that dream job. Weve aced that prolonged exercise routine. Weve tried that daunting diet. Weve eaten our hearts out. Weve visited that park near the house. Weve taken those midnight strolls. Weve met that distant neighbour. Weve adopted that kitten. Weve emailed that childhood friend. Weve returned calls. Weve gotten into short-term relationships without thinking twice. Weve formed bonds despite knowing they will end.
Weve lived differently, fully, selfishly and selflessly  but we have lived  even at the cost of incurring the wrath of our former selves. Under the garb of hostility, the pandemic has somewhat saved the planet from itself, and taught us the power to remember our own future. It has reminded us that surviving is choosing what to overcome. And that time is deciding when to forget.
This pandemic is always going to be the only film we see. History is being made, but its the past thats being rewritten. This is where stories have started. This is where conclusions have begun. To paraphrase the films most luminous moment: weve had our heads tilted up to the stars for as long as we can recall. But whats surprised us the most wasnt meeting the virus. It was meeting ourselves.
Maybe its fitting that the movies imagined a linguist saving the world. After all, its only the sound of language  a single letter  that distinguishes a world from a word.

Science fiction is never really about the future; its always about us. And Arrival, set in the barely distant future, feels like a movie tailor-made for 2016, dropping into theaters mere days after the most explosive election in most of the American electorates memory.
But the story Arrival is based on  the award-winning novella Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang  was published in 1998, almost two decades ago, which indicates its central themes were brewing long before this year. Arrival is much more concerned with deep truths about language, imagination, and human relationships than any one political moment.
Not only that, but Arrival is one of the best movies of the year, a moving, gripping film with startling twists and imagery. It deserves serious treatment as a work of art.
Arrival is smart, twisty, and serious
The strains of Max Richters ""On the Nature of Daylight"" play over the opening shots of Arrival, which is the first clue for whats about to unfold: that particular track is ubiquitous in the movies (I can count at least six or seven films that use it, including Shutter Island and this years The Innocents) and is, by my reckoning, the saddest song in the world.
The bittersweet feeling instantly settles over the whole film, like the last hour of twilight. Quickly we learn that Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) has suffered an unthinkable loss, and that functions as a prelude to the story: One day, a series of enormous pod-shaped crafts land all over earth, hovering just above the ground in 12 locations around the world. Nobody knows why. And nothing happens.
As world governments struggle to sort out what this means  and as the people of those countries react by looting, joining cults, even conducting mass suicides  Dr. Banks gets a visit from military intelligence, in the form of Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker), requesting her assistance as an expert linguist in investigating and attempting to communicate with whatever intelligence is behind the landing. She arrives at the site with Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), a leading quantum physicist, to start the mission. With help from a cynical Agent Halpern (Michael Stuhlbarg), they suit up and enter the craft to see if they can make contact.
Its best not to say much more about the plot, except that it is pure pleasure to feel it unfold. The most visionary film yet from director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) and scripted by horror screenwriter Eric Heisserer (Lights Out), its pacing is slower than youd expect from an alien-invasion film, almost sparse. For a movie with so many complicated ideas, it doesnt waste any more time on exposition than is absolutely necessary. Arrival is serious and smartly crafted, shifting around like a Rubiks cube in the hand of a savant, nothing quite making sense until all the pieces suddenly come together. I heard gasps in the theater.
Arrival is interested in how language shapes reality
The films premise hinges on the idea, shared by many linguists and philosophers of language, that we do not all experience the same reality. The pieces of it are the same  we live on the same planet, breathe the same air  but our perceptions of those pieces shift and change based on the words and grammar we use to describe them to ourselves and each other.
For instance, there is substantial evidence that a person doesnt really see (or perhaps ""perceive"") a color until their vocabulary contains a word, attached to meaning, that distinguishes it from other colors. All yellows are not alike, but without the need to distinguish between yellows and the linguistic tools to do so, people just see yellow. A color specialist at a paint manufacturer, however, can distinguish between virtually hundreds of colors of white. (Go check out the paint chip aisle at Home Depot if youre skeptical.)
Or consider the phenomenon of words in other languages that describe universal feelings, but can only be articulated precisely in some culture. We might intuitively ""feel"" the emotion, but without the word to describe it were inclined to lump the emotion in with another under the same heading. Once we develop the linguistic term for it, though, we can describe it and feel it as distinct from other shades of adjacent emotions.
These are simple examples, and I dont mean to suggest that the world itself is different for people from different cultures. But I do mean to suggest that reality  what we perceive as comprising the facts of existence  takes on a different shape depending on the linguistic tools we use to describe it.
Adopting this framework doesnt necessarily mean any of us are more correct than others about the nature of reality (though that certainly may be true). Instead, we are doing our best to describe reality as we see it, as we imagine it to be. This is the challenge of translation, and why literal translations that Google can perform dont go beyond basic sentences. Learning a new language at first is just about collecting a new vocabulary and an alternate grammar  here is the word for chair, here is the word for love, heres how to make a sentence  but eventually, as any bilingual person can attest, it becomes about imagining and perceiving the world differently.
This is the basic insight of Arrival: That if we were to encounter a culture so radically different from our own that simple matters we take for granted as part of the world as it is were radically shifted, we could not simply gather data, sort out grammar, and make conclusions. Wed have to either absorb a different way of seeing, despite our fear, or risk everything.

To underline the point, Dr. Banks and the entire operation are constantly experiencing breakdowns in communication within the team and with teams in other parts of the world, who arent sure whether the information they glean from their own visits to pods should be kept proprietary or shared.
Arrival is about more than talking to one another. Its about the roadmaps we use to navigate the world
Its not hard to see where this is going, I imagine  something about how if we want to empathize with each other we need to talk to one another, and thats the way the human race will survive.
And, sure.
But Arrival also layers in some important secondary notes that add nuance to that easy takeaway. Because its not just deciphering the words that someone else is saying thats important: Its the whole framework that determines how those words are being pinned to meaning. We can technically speak the same language, but functionally be miles apart.
In the film, one character notes that if we were to communicate in the language of chess  which operates in the framework of battles and wars  rather than, say, the language of English, which is bent toward the expression of emotions and ideas, then what we actually say and do would shift significantly. That is, the prevailing metaphor for how beings interact with each other and the world is different. (Some philosophers speak of this as ""language games."")
This matters for the films plot, but more broadly  since this is sci-fi, and therefore actually about us  it has implications. Language isnt just about understanding how to say things to someone and ascribe meaning to what comes back. Language has consequences. Embedded in words and grammar is action, because the metaphors that we use as we try to make sense of the world tell us what to do next. They act like little roadmaps.
You have empathized with someone not when you hear the words theyre saying, but when you begin to ascertain what metaphors make them tick, and where that conflicts or agrees with your own. I found myself thinking a lot about this reading Arlie Russell Hochschilds Strangers In Their Own Land, which is up for a National Book Award this year and describes the overarching metaphors (Hochschild calls them ""deep stories"") that discrete groups of Americans  in this case, West Coast urban liberals and Louisiana rural Tea Partiers  use to make sense of the world. She isnt trying to explain anything away. Shes trying to figure out what causes people to walk in such drastically different directions and hold views that befuddle their fellow citizens.
Arrival suggests that our mental roadmaps need constant adjustment
Part of the challenge of pluralism is that were not just walking around with different ideas in our heads, but with entirely different maps for getting from point A to Z, with different roadblocks on them and different recommendations for which road is the best one. Our A's and Z's dont even match. We dont even realize that our own maps are missing pieces that others have.
Presumably one of these maps is better than the others, but we havent agreed how we would decide. So we just keep smacking into one another going in opposite directions down the same highway.
Arrival takes off from this insight in an undeniably sci-fi direction that is a little brain-bending, improbable in the best way. But it makes a strong case that communication, not battle or combat, is the only way to avoid destroying ourselves. Communication means not just wrapping our heads around terms we use but the actual framework through which we perceive reality.
And that is really hard. I dont know how to fix it.
In the meantime, though, good movies are somewhere to start. Luckily Arrival is a tremendously well-designed film, with complicated and unpredictable visuals that embody the main point. Nothing flashy or explosive; in some ways, I found myself thinking of 1970s science-fiction films, or the best parts of Danny Boyles 2007 Sunshine, which grounded its humanist story in deep quiet.
The movie concludes on a different note from the linguistic one  one much more related to loss and a wistful question about life and risk. This may be Arrivals biggest weakness; the emotional punch of the ending is lessened a bit because it feels a little rushed.
But even that conclusion loops back to the possibilities of the reshaped human imagination. And this week, especially, you dont need to talk to an alien to see why thats something we need.

Denis Villeneuve specialises in films with grand themes and hollow centres, a builder of splendid edifices in which nobody is home. His last films, Prisoners and Sicario, were logy with self-importance; peel back their trumped-up moral quandaries and they verge on well-accomplished fraud. But with Arrival, Villeneuve finally finds a subject, and a script, whose magnitude matches the weight he assigns to it. All it took was an alien species' appearance on Earth.
The story of a talented linguist asked to decipher the creatures' low, nearly subsonic rumblings is also the story of Louise Banks (Amy Adams) coming to terms with her daughter's death. (No spoiler complaints, please: we find out in the first few minutes.) The creatures, dubbed heptapods because of their seven appendages, appear one day in grey, oblong ships that look like massive pebbles, hovering improbably above a field in Montana and elsewhere around the world  12 ships in all, the apostles to a messiah who may never arrive. Louise's memories of her daughter appear just as inexplicably, rupturing the movie's equally grey surface at moments that surprise even her. 
Understanding the aliens means challenging not only what we think we know but how we come to know it
The heptapods arrive without warning and without explanation; they seem to have no agenda they're able to express, or that we understand. But the mere fact of their existence turns the characters world on its side. Louise is called in by the US government because previous attempts to communicate have been thwarted by the tremendous difference between English and the aliens language, which goes all the way down to the root. They don't understand the world in terms of subjects and verbs, actors and objects. Understanding it means challenging not only what we think we know but how we come to know it.
Heavy stuff, right? Eric Heisserer's script dilutes or omits some of the more complex notions in Ted Chiang's short story, The Story of Your Life, but big-budget sci-fi of ideas is so rare that what survives the transition is plenty. Although he's clearly working from Steven Spielberg's template rather than forging his own, Villeneuve develops a clear and resonant conflict between those who want to study the creatures for knowledge's sake and those whose main concern is a potential alien invasion  or, just as bad, whatever advantage working with the aliens might give another of Earth's military powers. The ships are scattered around the globe apparently at random: the best explanation anyone can come up with is that the countries in which they've landed all gave Sheena Easton a hit single in the 1980s (a rare moment of levity in a movie that otherwise has little use for it).
Louise is joined on Team Knowledge by Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), a theoretical physicist who tries to breach the language gap with science instead of words. But there again, their efforts are stymied. Concepts that seem elementary to us are complex to the heptapods, and vice-versa; it's as if they started reading the encyclopedia at Z. Meanwhile, the world grows increasingly nervous: markets roil, people riot, and the world's governments come to doubt their initial commitment to sharing information. The Chinese military, represented mainly by Tzi Ma's General Shang, serve as a kind of all-purpose bogeyman, but that's as much in the minds of the increasingly jumpy US government officials as it may be in reality. There's a not especially subtle idea lurking just beneath the surface: how can we begin to know another species when we don't know our own?
Through a glass darkly
The heptapods' speech turns out to be indecipherable; one cinema-shaking groan sounds the same as another. But Louise is able to get a handle on their writing, which takes the form of fluid, inky circles that seems as much a living thing as the heptapods themselves. Louise, Ian and the anonymous gun-toting flunkies who accompany them, never make physical contact with the aliens: their encounters take place inside the ships, where they face a translucent rectangle that might be a pane of glass or an ultra-high-definition screen, through which the heptapods' bodies are partially visible through what looks like billowing fog. (Villeneuve is working for the first time with cinematographer Bradford Young, who emphasises the grit and grime in the movie's CGI tableaux.) The closer Louise comes to understanding their language, the more she begins to think as they do, and the more memories of her daughter seem to come rushing back with greater force and clarity.
As Louise delves further into the heptapods' language, the way she sees the world itself begins to change (to say more would be telling), but Adams turns her revelations inward rather than out. For all Arrival owes to Steven Spielberg, shes the inverse of Richard Dreyfuss raving evangelist in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, a prophet biding her time until humanity is ready to know what she knows. She finds an unexpectedly receptive ally in Forest Whitakers American colonel, although the unplaceable accent he adopts for the role seems designed to test the skills of even the worlds most proficient linguist.
Arrival's sci-fi goes softest in its final phase, which counts on our eyes being flooded with tears so we dont see the plots gears grinding. But it's the first of Villeneuve's movies in which that sentimentality feels earned, and even welcome.",AJP_Doc5_Arrival_Is_The,Austin Pelletier,Sci-Fi,Positive,Arrival

Can a science-fiction film be Oscar bait? Eons agoin 2009this would have been a ridiculous question. Prior to that year, only three such movies had ever been nominated for best picture: A Clockwork Orange, Star Wars, and E.T. But in the seven years since the category expanded beyond five nominees, seven films from the genre have been nominated. Most have tended towards the brainy (Her), the mind-bending (Inception), and the wonky (The Martian). All togetherwith the possible exception of Mad Max: Fury Roadthis batch of sci-fi nominees seems less interested in escapist thrills than in scientific accuracy (see also Gravity) and political allegory (Avatar, District 9). Theyre popcorn as engineered through molecular gastronomy.
Enter Arrival. The new film from Denis Villeneuve checks each and every one of these boxes. Its brainy, with its hero linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) offering explications of concepts like the SapirWhorf hypothesis. Its mind-bending, reveling in the kind of time paradoxes that dare you to diagram them with elaborate flowcharts. And its wonky, with its other main character, a theoretical mathematician played by Jeremy Renner, explaining one of the films twists by revealing that .083333  is (spoiler alert?) precisely equivalent to 1/12.
And like many recent prestige sci-fi movies (and so many nonprestigious ones), Arrival focuses on alien contact. That alien race first appears around the globe in giant, somewhat Sphere-ical spaceshipsand thanks to the films coy marketing strategy, you probably have no idea what they look like. (I wont spoil their appearance, which is relatively novel, except to say: Why do movie aliens always have to be green?) This restraint is admirable, but its also, arguably, born of necessity. If you go into this mid-budget film with the expectation that it will erupt into a third-act CGI spectacle, you will be disappointed.

Instead, the films tagline Why are they here? is in fact its driving question. Most of the action, such as it is, involves Amy Adams linguist and Jeremy Renners mathematician trying to speak to the aliens and figure out what theyre saying back. All the chat about nonlinear orthography can get a bit academic, and its dominant motif also functions as a kind of microcosm of all these brainy, high-toned sci-fi movies: scientists pointing markers at whiteboards while explaining the inner workings of the plot.

Theres another film, of course, that checked all these boxes, whiteboards and all, and received a lot of Oscar buzzthough it ultimately failed to convert all this into a best picture nomination. And like Interstellar, Arrival is only intermittently stellar. Indeed, it resembles, above all, that and other Christopher Nolan movies. Its idea-heavy dialogue is often clunky, such as when Adams voice-over muses, We are so bound by time. By its order. (Yeah, man.) Selma cinematographer Bradford Youngs carefully composed images are mostly drained of color. The mood is mournful, even though the dead girl being mourned (another common feature of Nolans films) only appears in visions and flashbacks. Its score, courtesy of the brilliant Icelandic composer Jhann Jhannsson, is eerie and romantic, but its reminiscent less of Brahms than brAAAAHMS. And it has a twist ending that will leave you puzzling over the mechanics of its rug-pulling. Watching it, I was excited that such a strange piece of science fiction got madeand disappointed to realize that it is strange in just about all the ways that Interstellar is.

But while even Nolans detractors couldnt deny his skill at manufacturing awe, the primary emotion that Arrival evokes is puzzlement. For most of the films runtime, the two main characters remain, like the aliens language, ciphers; the great actors Michael Stuhlbarg and Forest Whitaker, meanwhile, mostly serve the familiar roles of the hawkish military man and the confused audience surrogate (i.e. the Ariadne). Meanwhile, though there are moments of striking, inventive imagerysuch as an Inception-like journey down a hallway whose gravity pulls in more than one directionthey are brief.

Still, its perhaps unfair to compare this mid-budget, $47 million feature to the work of our most successful creator of original mega-budget films, and there are also ways in which Arrival improves on Nolans work. For one, it actually passes the Bechdel test (either just barely or, depending on the gender identity of the aliens, with flying colors). This is not surprising from director Villeneuve, whose last film was the war-on-drugs thriller Sicario, which similarly centered on a woman who is as tough as the men who surround her.

But Arrival has another theme, and although its secondary, its the one that is likely to stand out most to moviegoers watching the movie after the election of President Trump. The movie depicts a divided world where people struggle to understand each other, where panic leads groups to wall themselves off, watch their own media, and burrow deeper into their own bunkers. In the end, of course, our heroes figure out how to transcend these barriersbut the solution is a deus ex machina beamed down by the extraterrestrials. For all the movies attention to whiteboards and arcane linguistic theories, this week it feels like a total fantasy.

There are days in human experience that shatter our understanding of the world, forcing us to reconsider what we thought we knew as we struggle to piece things back together. Denis Villeneuve's elegiac science-fiction drama ""Arrival"" follows the aftermath of such a day, and the emotional tidal waves it eventually unleashes.
Based on Ted Chiang's short tale ""The Story of Your Life,"" ""Arrival"" focuses on an alien invasion of Earth. But this is not a spectacle-packed action flick in the vein of ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Independence Day"" or even a suspenseful sci-fi thriller like ""Gravity"" or ""Ex Machina."" Instead, Villeneuve's follow-up to his lauded crime-drama ""Sicario"" offers a much subtler and more solemn exploration of this sci-fi subgenre. Focusing on linguistics professor Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), ""Arrival"" guides us through the American government's earnest but anxious efforts to make sense of an alien invasion that's placed enormous floating vessels above 12 seemingly random spots around the globe, including rural Montana.
Villeneuve's film kicks off with the dizzying reality of these mysterious extraterrestrial's arrival. It was an average day until that moment. Louise strides into her lecture perplexed by the poor attendance. The students seem distracted, checking their phones, until one entreats her to turn the classroom's television to the news. And just like that, with one simple, striking image, the world as we know it is different. The Canadian filmmaker doesn't indulge in melodramatic gnashing of teeth or cries of shock. And this grounds the film in an eerie authenticity. Watching this simple scene -- that admittedly contains no violence -- I was reminded how on 9/11, I sat in a college class, confused when a peer whispered something about a plane crash in Manhattan. As we joined the masses of students who steadily filed out of the campus and onto buses, subways and sidewalks, the quiet was rattling. Horrified and confused, many of us didn't seem to know what to say, and so we stared, scared and silent, awaiting whatever comes next.
How do you make sense of the unimaginable? That is the question playing at the core of Villeneuve's daring drama that refuses to gussy itself up with scares or outlandish stunts. Nobly pressing on to communicate with these cryptic creatures, Louise teams with a brash scientist (Jeremy Renner), racing to decode the extraterrestrial's language and thereby their purpose on Earth. Meanwhile, China teeters on the brink of igniting intergalactic war. All the while, Villeneuve's cast--which boasts solid supporting turns by Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg--strives for tension and poignance through strained discussions about the importance of language to perspective.
It's an interesting concept, and a remarkably restrained film, rich with foreboding. I admire Villeneuve ambition and appreciate the humane message that beats at the heart to his story. But as the plot clunks from one tame close encounter to another, I became increasingly, unsalvageably bored. This is decidedly not my kind of sci-fi.
The understated performances completely make sense within the world of a military installment striving for a peaceful resolution. Carrying an incredible yet casual gravitas, Adams is intriguing as this under-pressure civilian. But with no action, weak suspense and little mirth, the tone steadily becomes a relentless one-note dirge. Though seemingly sophisticated, ""Arrival"" squanders its strong start with a plodding pace that trudges through a maudlin mood toward a finale that indulges in one of sci-fi's most infuriating deus ex machina tropes. Though initially fascinating, Villeneuve's indulgence in mood and melancholy mount to a conclusion that wastes its compelling premise and wallows in infuriatingly all-consuming sentimentality.

How do you create a movie about space aliens and still make it seem new? This is the conundrum posed, and not all that ably resolved, by Arrival, which stars Amy Adams as Dr. Louise Banks, a linguistics professor who is tasked by the US military with figuring out how to communicate with the squiggly, squidlike extraterrestrials whose spaceships, landed on Earth, resemble an immense ultrasleek cough drop.
It begins promisingly, with scattershot TV reports of the alien landings inciting increasing dread. A reluctant Louise is recruited by an Army colonel (Forest Whitaker) to decode the squealing language of the aliens, whose spaceships are ominously parked at 12 locations around the world.
We have already been given a quick rundown on Louises fraught life leading up to this moment: the unexplained loss of her husband and the death of her only child, a daughter, to cancer. Her mournfulness is all of a piece with the films pallid, grayish ambience. Earth may well be worth saving, but Arrival doesnt exactly make the best case for it.
The mounting, low-key anxiety serves the film well for a while because Denis Villeneuve, directing from a script by Eric Heisserer, makes you believe that, yes, this is the way it might really happen if aliens landed. Its also believable that the arrivals might touch off a global game of chicken, with Russia and China pushing the brinkmanship. 
Fairly soon, alas, it becomes clear that Villeneuve (Sicario, Prisoners) is a director lacking not only humor but also a sense of the transcendent. The humorlessness is partially forgivable, although I must say I have been spoiled ever since Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which managed to be both loads of fun and mind-boggling. (This is what The Martian also aimed for, and missed.)
But its difficult to get worked into a state of awe with this film because so much of it is so sodden. I half wished the aliens would blow something real big up just to break the monotony, but it turns out they are friendly  sort of. They eject squid ink-like messages that, once decoded, mean something like We come in peace. Turns out they want to literally change the way earthlings think by rewiring our brain circuits with their language, which, once learned, can alter our space-time continuum. Or at least Louises. Or something like that.
I guess it doesnt matter exactly what this film is about. Except it does. When weve come this far, I rightly expect that all this  circle-of-time hoo-ha will amount to something more than a great big Huh? 
A halfhearted attempt is made by the filmmakers to give Louise a love interest: a theoretical physicist, played by Jeremy Renner, whose quota of Aha! moments is thankfully kept to a minimum. Unfortunately, just about everything about this guy is kept to a minimum. Hes a plot device, except, of course, there isnt much of a plot.

I realize Im not supposed to be so cavalier about a movie that clearly is aiming for Importance  not to mention Oscars  but it would take a hardier soul than I am to suppress a snicker when Louise enters the spaceships dismal, honeycombed interior, bravely sheds her orange hazmat suit, and holds up a sign saying Human. Unless theres something truly momentous going on, I prefer my sci-fi to be a lot more weightless than weighty. Grade: C+ (Rated PG-13 for brief strong language.)

At first, they look like giant black eggs hovering in the sky. Seen up close and in profile, they are more like the dark slashes in a Lucio Fontana canvas. These are the extraterrestrial spacecraft in Arrival, which appear suddenly one morning and plonk themselves in assorted locations across the planet with little or no regard for parking restrictions.
Arrival itself is less unexpected. Early November is the official launch period for adult-oriented science-fiction movies angling for awards recognition: Gravity, Interstellar and The Martian were all released in that slot and Arrival contains DNA carefully extracted from each. From Interstellar, it lifts a circular plot structure, signalled far in advance by an opening speech disputing the notion of beginnings and endings. From The Martian, it takes its pragmatic approach to a fantastical situation, represented in the new film by the challenge of communicating with alien visitors. Most importantly, Arrival borrows from Gravity a grieving female protagonist, in this case the linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams), who is mourning the loss of her daughter.
The screenwriter Eric Heisserer, working from a short story by Ted Chiang, knows that there can be no faster route to empathy than a dead child, and the director, Denis Villeneuve, finds the appropriate visual register for a montage of the girls life in the soft hues and artful blurs redolent of a commercial for private health care.
Louise lives alone in a stylishly chilly waterfront property, far too pricey for an academic to afford but spacious enough to denote emotional desolation. So when the US government requests that she join the physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) to instigate a conversation with the aliens, the project provides respite from her grief. Inside the spacecraft docked in Montana, they converse through a gleaming white rectangle that suggests a blank cinema screen. Tentacles figure strongly in the composition of the creatures, who communicate by honking like trombones and spraying inky characters on the screen for Louise to decipher.
It is fitting that these splodges resemble Rorschach blots, since the film is concerned not with the enigmas of an exotic species but with what the extraterrestrials existence might reveal about the human race. Where Close Encounters of the Third Kind gazed outward in awe at the universe, Arrival asks only how its mysteries might provide succour and illumination for us. It couldnt be any more parochial in its outlook if Louise and Ian were shown posing for selfies with the aliens.
As the story loops round on itself and Louises memories of her daughter start to provide clues and pointers, the film becomes carried away by its attempts at profundity. The past is the future . . . The future is the present . . . The child had a palindromic name . . . She made clay models that predicted what the aliens would look like . . . In a movie, the air of cosmic spookiness is less impressive than in life, because these are not really coincidences at all but markers placed in advance by the film-makers over the course of many drafts. A genuinely magical picture (Donnie Darko, say) generates a mystique that outlasts its plot surprises. Arrival is the opposite sort of film. Though secular in nature, its promises of continuous life make it as simplistically comforting as any religious parable.
It may have escaped the directors attention also that Nicolas Roeg has made a long and wonderful career out of exploring, with a good deal less fanfare, the idea that is central to his film. In Walkabout, Dont Look Now and Bad Timing, the past, present and future exist simultaneously and it takes only a snip of the editors scissors to move between those time frames.
For Villeneuve, however, cinema is all about making big statements, and damn the details. He doesnt notice, in the process of telling Louises story, that the aliens are relegated to the status of McGuffins in their own movie or that the entire world is nudged to the very brink of war just so that a well-off university professor can sleep more soundly at night.

Bond is back, and this time, he's scary.
Daniel Craig takes over the role Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan had before him in Casino Royale. Craig gives us a virile, athletic, dangerous, amoral spy, a guy fond of other men's wives, and a killer unafraid of killing.
He's also humorless. The guy couldn't tell a joke or manage a quip to save his Aston-Martin. So they don't give him many. No ""Q,"" no real gadgets to brag about. This is a serious, bloody-minded Bond for a serious age. He's not droll, witty or even particularly British.
The chases are more visceral, the fights more personal in Casino Royale, which isn't even remotely a remake of that 1967 farce starring Peter Sellers and David Niven. This is an updating of Ian Fleming's 1953 introductory Bond novel, and Martin Campbell's film is an attempt at reinventing the character and the franchise.
Shot more arrestingly than most Bond films -- a striking blue-gray and white opening makes one wonder, for a minute, if they'll have the nerve to render the antiquated Bond in a period piece -- featuring one of the best chases the series has ever had, it's still a movie built around a card game.
And that, friends, is a problem. Casino Royale is just swell when Bond is busting up bathrooms in Prague, busting up embassies in Madagascar and busting a move in Nassau. But when he gets to, well, Casino Royale (here, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro), the film goes utterly flat.
The villain is a gambling ""banker"" for international terrorists (he calls them ""freedom fighters""). Le Chiffre (""the cipher"") has the puffy lips and glistening, sweaty skin and oiled-down hair of a B-movie Nazi. He's also an asthmatic who occasionally bleeds out of one of his scarred tear-ducts. Not good for your poker face.
And that's important. Because the game is no longer that exotic card contest of the super-rich, baccarat. It's Texas hold 'em. How common.
Mads Mikkelsen (Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself) doesn't embody the classic Bond villain, in that he's not larger than life. The classic ""Bond girl"" is Eva Green (Kingdom of Heaven), an intoxicating beauty with little screen presence. She's a government banker-liaison who comes to the casino with Bond to bankroll him in a $10 million entry game which, it is hoped, will bring the roof down on Le Chiffre and his whole terrorist layaway plan.
The cute stuff here is the odd reference to a classic 1964 Aston-Martin; a ""Money"" and ""Penny"" joke, because Miss Moneypenny is not included; Bond's discovery of the cool way to say his name; the cool drink to order, ""shaken, not stirred""; and his first meeting with his CIA counterpart (Jeffrey Wright is Felix Leiter).
Craig's Bond occasionally lets us see the human being behind the gun. But really, here it's ""Bring on the sado-masochism, Mr. Bond,"" as Craig (Layer Cake, Munich) dishes it out. And takes it.
It's not as bad as Die Another Day, and not up to the jolly mayhem of the best films in the series. Casino Royale is an overlong movie making an overdue move in a promising Bourne Identity direction. Most important, it's good enough to ensure that Mr. Bond will be in the game for at least one more hand.

Sometimes a film speaks most clearly in what it doesn't bother to say. One such occasion is the opening scene of Casino Royale, in which James Bond confronts a turncoat within British intelligence. Bond is played by Daniel Craig in his rookie outing, and he is played, appropriately enough, as a rookie agent, or at least as one who has not yet been granted his iconic label, ""007."" To ascend to that rank, we are told, requires two sanctioned kills--one, evidently, for each ""oh."" His first was the man who led him to the turncoat, and it was not a pretty one: Bond beat him bloodily before drowning him in the sink of a public restroom. ""Made you feel it, didn't he?"" the turncoat asks. ""Well you needn't worry, the second is--."" Rather than complete the thought, he fulfills it, as Bond casually shoots him through the chest before concurring: ""Yes, considerably."" The word that neither man utters, of course, is ""easier,"" and its elision is telling. This is the first Bond movie in decades, perhaps ever, that respects its audience enough to let them fill in the trope for themselves. From its first frames, Casino Royale, just released on video, promises to restore the trimmed-down urgency of the early Sean Connery outings as Bond, before the franchise grew so fat and tired and stupid: The MGM lion and the Columbia Pictures torch-lady are both presented in black and white; when onscreen type announces that the first scene is set in Prague, there's a knowing pause, as if to hint this could be some Cold War-era John le Carr adaptation (The Spy Who Loved to Come in from the Cold?), before it confesses its era with ""Czech Republic."" But Casino Royale exceeds this promise, presenting a Bond both leaner and meaner than any that has come before. That this is the best Bond flick in nearly four decades is beyond reasonable dispute; whether it's better even than the early Connerys is a subject worthy of debate. Who could have imagined that the franchise could lift itself up so quickly from the laughable depths of Die Another Day, with its invisible cars and one-man war against the North Korean Army? Though Casino Royale was produced by the same folks responsible for that self-parodying rubbish, it feels as though the rights to the story somehow fell into the hands of an outsider, who fashioned the film as a ""fuck you"" to Bond's official custodians. Rebukes to the franchise's errors and excesses are everywhere: an opening action sequence that consists merely (but marvelously) of two men chasing one another on foot through a construction site; Bond's joke to his female partner that her cover-name is ""Miss Stephanie Broadchest""; the villain's explanation, ""I never understood all these elaborate tortures,"" before he pummels Bond's privates with a knotted rope; Bond's response, when asked whether he'd like his martini shaken or stirred: ""Do I look like I give a damn?"" It is an almost inexpressible relief that the niftiest spy gadget in the entire film is the medical kit hidden in Bond's car. Unlike recent Bonds, whose kills had no more weight than the one-liners that generally accompanied them, Craig's tend to be intimate, bloody, and devoid of glamour: the restroom murder that opens the movie; a slow, painful strangulation in the bottom of a stairwell. In the latter half of the movie alone, Craig goes through more tuxedo shirts--gore-soaked, waterlogged, shredded--than Roger Moore seemed to dirty during his entire Bond tenure. Craig is also the first Bond who is not openly pleasure-seeking, whose sexual escapades are clearly intended to further his mission, rather than the other way around. This correction is made most explicit when Bond engages in some light foreplay with a Bahamian lovely in order to find out what her villainous husband might be up to. ""Apparently, he's on the last flight to Miami,"" she informs him between nibbles, ""so you have all night to question me."" In response, Bond phones room service to send up a little beluga and bubbly. But when he's asked ""For two, sir?"" his reply is terse: ""No, one."" Cut to him speeding to the airport. The last several Bonds would probably have let it wait 'til morning; even Connery would at least have allowed himself a wistful sigh at his coital self-sacrifice. It's as if the franchise at last felt forced to decide between carnal vocations for its hero and opted, wisely, for assassin over gigolo. Even the opening credits forsake the tease of quasi-naked jiggle bunnies in favor of a neatly stylized series of animated executions. And Craig makes a superb assassin. It's not just that he seems more likely to have killed someone than any of his smirking predecessors; it's that he seems likely to have killed them with his forehead. Though a handsome actor (and, according to a disconcerting number of female friends, the sexiest man on the big screen in ages), Craig has not a whiff of prettiness to him. His face is angular but unlovely: the mouth a little wide, the brow a little heavy, the eyes tilting down morosely at the sides. He's the first Bond one doesn't envision spending a great deal of time in front of the mirror. (The gym is another matter: He's so lean you could use him to cut vegetables.) The film does let down Craig's performance (and viewers) here and there. The plot meanders a bit before arriving at its titular destination: a high-stakes poker game pitting Bond against Le Chiffre (Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen), a man who is described as the ""private banker to the world's terrorists,"" and who, like the statue of a medieval saint, weeps tears of blood. The game itself is staged rather inertly (and, according to those who know something about cards, ridiculously). And the movie's denouement suffers a bit from Return of the Kingitis: You think it's over several times before it actually is. But given the revelatory improvement over the last dozen-plus Bond outings, these are quibbles. Regarding Bond's love interest, a heretically fetching accountant named Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), the film reaches high but falls a little short. It's certainly nice to see Bond's custodians strive for a genuine romance, a sharp sparring between attracted minds (and, yes, not only minds). But the chemistry between Craig and Green is never much in evidence, their repartee isn't quite so clever as the filmmakers think, and her eventual surrender (whatever its explanation) is too abrupt and too complete to be satisfying. This is the second film in which 007 has fallen truly in love, and the second time that love was doomed. The first was On Her Majesty's Secret Service, starring another freshman Bond--Aussie model George Lazenby, who took over from Connery in 1969 but never made it to a sophomore outing. Like Casino Royale, it too followed Ian Fleming's novel relatively closely, downplayed gadgetry in favor of dramatic depth, and served as a kind of explanation for Bond's darker treatment of the fairer sex. Despite a somewhat leaden performance by Lazenby, it's among the best of the Bond films (thanks, largely, to the magnificent Diana Rigg, the Bond Girl against whom all others must be measured), and it might have offered a model for reinvigorating the franchise. Instead, it was followed by Diamond's Are Forever, a lamely semi-comic, gizmo-stuffed entry that foreshadowed the disappointing decades to come. There's no real reason to expect that Casino Royale will have a similar one-and-done quality. The fact that it has been widely described as a ""reboot"" suggests at least some awareness by the producers that the franchise had crashed; and Daniel Craig's decision to return for another tour is good news indeed. Still, in mass-market filmmaking it's often easier to throw in a space-based laser than a good line of dialogue, and it's an open question how long the franchise will be able to resist such temptations. But for now, Bond fans have--for the first time in a long, long time--something to savor. The Home Movies List: Rebooting Bond Casino Royale (1967). After acquiring the rights to Fleming's novel, producer Charles K. Feldman initially wanted it to be part of the usual Bond ""canon."" When gatekeepers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman turned him away, he instead opted to make it a spoof. Sadly, star Peter Sellers wanted to play Bond ""straight,"" feuded with Orson Welles (his Le Chiffre), and quit before completing his footage--a departure that forced the filmmakers to reframe the entire film as a kaleidoscope of competing ""Bonds"" (David Niven, Woody Allen, Ursula Andress, et cetera). A disaster from beginning to end, too pitiful even to laugh at. On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). Great moments in career management: Lazenby turned down a seven-picture deal because he felt the tuxedoed Bond was too square to flourish in the counter-cultural 1970s. Instead, he went on to a career starring in martial arts pictures, spoofing Bond (The Nude Bomb, The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.), and marrying former tennis pro Pam Shriver. The Living Daylights (1987). Another attempt to return Bond to his darker, more serious roots that didn't really pan out. Dalton, who'd first been offered the role of Bond for On Her Majesty's Secret Service (when he was in his early 20s), never quite had the big-screen charisma for the role and lasted just two pictures. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997). A spoof along the lines of the first Casino Royale that succeeded far better--Bond by way of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, ""The Bionic Woman,"" A Hard Day's Night, and Alfie. The Matador (2005). Pierce Brosnan's most winning portrayal of Bond wasn't Bond at all, but the wickedly decadent and self-loathing assassin Julian Noble in this underrated black comedy. It almost seems as though Brosnan needed to kill off the Bond mystique once and for all before Daniel Craig could give it new life. This post originally appeared at TNR.com.

At the screening of Casino Royale, the 21st James Bond film, the aisles were patrolled by menacing heavies equipped with night-vision goggles. It was like something out of . . . well, out of a James Bond film. Forget preventing piracy: their real brief was to eject anyone caught enjoying themselves excessively. This latest Bond film has nothing in common with the 1967 spoof version of Casino Royale, and exhibits little of the jokiness of the official series, which once prized gags as much as guns. This is a serious, even downbeat, endeavour. It begins in black and white. It contains graphic violence. And there are no gadgets, though Bond does throw a pistol at someone. But it's hardly up there with the jet-powered backpack.

In this pared-down revamp, the plot is as lean as the new leading man, Daniel Craig, and the entire story revolves around money. No fleets of submarines or plans for world domination - just money. Bond is pursuing Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a private banker to the worlds terrorists. Le Chiffre has carelessly blown his clients funds on a stock-market gamble and is out to recoup the cash before they demand his limbs in lieu of payment. To this end, he sets up a multimillion-dollar poker game that he must contrive to win. If Bond can leave him penniless at the poker table, Le Chiffre will have no choice but to seek refuge from his terrorist pursuers by turning informer for MI6. At least, thats the plan.

Some delightfully kitsch touches intrude on the dourness of Casino Royale. One scene has Bond emerging from the ocean, in trunks so tight they could be tattoos, to watch a raven-haired beauty riding a white horse along the beach; you half expect Duran Duran to wander into shot. Then there is the sultry music that plays whenever a woman appears on screen, just in case we hadnt noticed her in, say, that low-cut, red silk number. And Le Chiffre, with his significant facial scars, upholds the fine tradition of Bond villains - he weeps tears of blood and uses an asthma inhaler. All right, so the inhaler isnt that evil. But Le Chiffre does devise a torture for Bond that involves stripping him naked, tying him to a chair with the seat ripped out and then doing something unspeakable to his genitals. Bond takes this punishment remarkably well - as he attended public school, it must seem like old times.

Ever since Roger Moore was released from his contract when it emerged that he had been clinically dead since 1979, the Bond series has flirted with grittiness. In The World Is Not Enough (1999), for instance, Bond shot a woman at point blank range and didn't even have the decency to deliver a light-hearted quip afterwards. It's all in keeping with Ian Fleming's conception of his hero as a sadistic brute, and Craig brings the character even closer to those origins. He does such a convincing job of uncovering the stalactite that Bond has in place of a heart that there should be no need for the film to keep telling us what a cad he is. Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), the accountant who accompanies Bond to Casino Royale to bankroll his poker game, calls him a ""cold bastard"". His perpetually disapproving boss, M (Judi Dench), says: ""I would ask you to remain emotionally detached, but I don't think that's your problem."" We don't need these reminders when Craig says it all, and more, with a mere glance.

The film allows him to commit all manner of beastly acts; by the time the opening credits begin, he has already drowned an adversary in a sink. But thats not half as cruel as one look from those arctic blue eyes. The most chilling moment in the film has nothing to do with Le Chiffre: its the impassive expression that Bond wears as he watches the woman who was caressing him the night before being zipped into a body-bag. You can see him mentally crossing out her name in his little black book, for ever. Its a characteristic touch in a film that strips most of the glamour and escapism from Bond, but remains the truest and toughest instalment yet.",ARR_Doc2_James_Bond_Casino_Royale_Review_Positive,Anish Randeria,Action,Positive,James Bond Casino Royale

By rights he should be well into middle age, but James Bond turns 21 (movies, that is) here with a new look and a fresh start.
Double-0-seven can't compete with Tarzan or Godzilla for screen outings, but neither of these worthies can match him for consistency.
His escapades stretch back to the Cuban Missile Crisis and span nine U.S. presidents, notwithstanding a six-year moratorium after the fall of the Berlin Wall (and the toppling of Timothy Dalton).
Judging by the box office returns for the last film, he's lost little of his appeal; the dire ""Die Another Day"" made $432 million worldwide.
The changing of the guard has become a significant element in the long-term sustainability of the franchise, and the most compelling reason to see ""Casino Royale"" is obviously to check out Bond Mark VI, Daniel Craig.
Breathe easy -- he passes the test with flying colors. And you need not read too much into an early crack about the short life expectancy of the double 0s, since he's already signed on for two more films.
Well established in the UK for dramatic roles in ""Mother"" and ""Enduring Love,"" Craig may be more familiar to American audiences for his supporting turns in ""Munich,"" ""Infamous"" and ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.""
Blond, muscular and pugnacious, he is closer to Sean Connery's working-class insolence than his smarmier successors. This is a utilitarian, back-to-basics Bond, a ""blunt instrument,"" as M (Judi Dench) puts it (echoing Bond author Ian Fleming), stripped of the knowing smirk and salacious wink.
Which is not to say Craig's Bond isn't cocky -- that's his designated character flaw -- but the rough edges haven't been shaved off yet.
""Shaken or stirred?"" inquires a barman.""Do I look like I give a damn?"" Bond shoots back.It's appropriate the vehicle for this relaunch should be Fleming's first novel. ""Casino Royale"" was filmed as a spoof in 1967, but it's no more inherently ridiculous than any of the others, and the (quite faithful) new version leans over backward to play down the series' more decadent accoutrements: the girls, the gadgets and the gizmos (though not, alas, the product placement).
Although bad guy Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) has acquired the baroque habit of crying blood, he's a banker looking for profit, not a megalomaniac thirsting for world domination.
Too bad for him Bond foils a plan to blow up a prototype super-sized airliner at Miami airport (the second of the film's big three action set-pieces). After taking a bath at the stock market, Le Chiffre organizes a multimillion-dollar private poker tournament to win back his dodgy clients' money.
The British Treasury stakes Bond to the tune of $10 million, but sends Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) along to keep tabs on the taxpayers' investment. Given Le Chiffre's glaringly obvious ""tell,"" it seems like a good bet.
And speaking of tells, there's no way of knowing for sure which parts of the script belong to Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (veterans of the last two Brosnan Bonds) and which were glossed by the seemingly ubiquitous Paul Haggis (""Crash,"" ""Million Dollar Baby""), but the old-school romantic sparring between Vesper and Bond has the double Oscar winner's fingerprints all over it: both for the gallant stab at sophisticated repartee and the earnest attempts to invest these fantasy figures with psychological depth.
He even pokes around for some vestige of dormant humanity in the disquietingly professional killer.
This Bond bleeds and bruises, though he also gives as good as he gets. Then he goes sappy on us -- another lesson to be learned over time (144 minutes of it). In this fourth act the movie finally overplays its hand.
Despite Green's spirited performance, the plot stops dead in its tracks for a spot of lethargic and unconvincing R & R. When the expected twist finally arrives, the climactic showdown in a Venetian townhouse doesn't muster the emotional wallop exacted by ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" in similar circumstances.
Still, there's clearly life in the old dog yet. Bond may or may not be relevant in the New World Disorder, but against all odds he remains a potent figure.
Consider: As usual, the filmmakers serve their best up front. It's a high-wire chase scene starting in a construction site and ending with a shoot-'em-up in an (unnamed) embassy. The bit is an uproarious demonstration of sheer reckless endeavor. No introductions are necessary. Who else could it be?

Daniel Craig is no Sean Connery, and in the case of Casino Royale, that's a good thing.Casino Royale is the 21st film featuring James Bond. The British secret agent with the code name of 007 made his first movie appearance in 1962's Dr. No, starring Connery, who came to embody the role. Other Bonds, including Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan, have their fans, but the actors all worked in the shadow of Connery, perhaps because they were trying to be true to the character he created.
The only way that an addition to the Bond film pantheon could be anything other than a retread is to strip away most of the links to the past and start fresh.
Director Martin Campbell, who also directed Goldeneye, Brosnan's inaugural turn as 007, and veteran Bond writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade bring to Casino Royale a feel for what Bond is all about. But they have three major allies in their campaign to breathe life into a film franchise showing its age.
The first is a willingness to start at the beginning, with the book in which Ian Fleming introduced Bond more than half a century ago. The second is Craig, who has the most penetrating blue eyes this side of Paul Newman and whose face seems to have been formed by Silly Putty, so flexible are his features, shifting easily from craggy good looks to physical agony to surprise to ardor to anger to arrogance. Craig's Bond is no supremely self-confident, suave agent with an ice-cold heart, although by the movie's end, it's easy to see how he will become that way.
The third is perhaps the most valuable asset of all. Joining the writing team is newcomer (to the Bond legacy) Paul Haggis, who had a hand in writing two movies you may have heard of: Crash, which he also directed, and Million Dollar Baby, both best-picture Oscar winners. Haggis brings an edginess and modern sensibility to the script, making this Bond more credible and less of a superhero.
Similarities to other Bond movies include several beautiful women, lots of car chases, fiery explosions, and a high body count, all of which serve to camouflage a thin plot.
Casino Royale opens with a brief black-and-white segment in Prague that shows how Bond earned his double-0 status, then segues to Madagascar, where Bond botches an assignment, much to the fury of his boss, M, who coldly tells him that she should never have promoted him so soon and orders him to take an extended vacation until the furor blows over.
He heads to the Bahamas, a perfect vacation spot, except that he isn't on vacation; he's trying to atone for the botched job, and the trail leads him to Le Chiffre, preferred banker to the world's terrorists. When Bond manages to mess up one of Le Chiffre's ""investments,"" the money-man, strapped for cash, decides to set up a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro to recoup his losses.
M, who is reassessing Bond's potential, assigns him to win the game and bankrupt Le Chiffre, then offer him asylum in exchange for what he knows. She authorizes the multimillion-dollar stake but sends along an accountant, Vesper Lynd, to keep an eye on the money as well as the agent.
Lynd is not the normal ""Bond girl."" She's smart, confident, independent, and focused on her work. She's also beautiful, but that's due as much to her intelligence as her physical attributes. The initial meeting between Bond and Lynd, as they size each other up, and their continuing repartee is one of the pleasures of the film.
Then there's the poker game. In the book, Bond played Chemin de Fer, but the writers updated everything else, so why not the game that viewers can find somewhere on cable TV at any time of the day or night? The scenes are interminable, and it's an opportune moment for a popcorn run.
And even when the poker game is over, the movie isn't. Casino Royale lasts two hours and 24 minutes, and the false endings are so abundant that when Bond utters his last line, it's somewhat of a surprise.
However, all throughout the film, the dialogue is sharp and the introduction to iconic Bond touches - among them the tailored tuxedo, the martini - are deftly handled, often with a great deal of humor.
The supporting cast is equally important and from Judi Dench, who brings her icy imperiousness to M, to Eva Green as the always-interesting Vesper Lynd, to Giancarlo Giannini, suavely continental as Bond's contact in Montenegro, to Mads Mikkelsen, deeply disturbing as Le Chiffre, each is well suited to what he or she has to do.
But this is a Bond movie, and everything comes back to him and the actor who plays him. The filmmakers took a big gamble on Daniel Craig and on a script that updates everything (except Dench; keeping her was a no-brainer).
This time, the gamble paid off.

For this critic, Commander James Bond is possibly the most boring fictional character ever invented, after Harry Potter. Still, half a century on from his initial appearance on the world stage, his owners haven't given up trying to teach their old dog some new tricks.
The latest entry in the cycle is an origin myth of sorts  an adaptation of Ian Fleming's first-ever Bond novel, previously filmed in 1967 as a majestically incoherent parody with five credited directors and an almost equal number of ""James Bond"" avatars on screen (including David Niven, Peter Sellers and Woody Allen).
The new Casino Royale has a script by the regular Bond team of Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, reworked by million-dollar screenwriter Paul Haggis. They've stuck relatively closely to the plot of Fleming's novel  really a novella  with the addition of a new first act.
When we're introduced to Bond (Daniel Craig) in a black-and-white prologue, he's not yet acquired his ""007"" status and is hardly even a killer  though his subsequent insouciance would suggest that he's been bumping off henchmen since the day he was born.
The fascination of this Casino Royale lies almost entirely in the offbeat casting of Craig, an accomplished character actor rather than a conventional leading man. With hair like a scrubbing-brush, ears that stick out, and a creased monkey face, Craig has to become Bond by sheer force of personality, a process that constitutes the true subject of the film.
I can only wish the producers had been similarly adventurous in their choice of director. Though the reportedly eager Quentin Tarantino might have been too much of a risk, it would have been fascinating to watch someone such as Michael Mann go to work on Bond's fashion sense and his lonely, ambiguous heroism.
Instead, we're left with the Bond veteran Martin Campbell, who in earlier projects, from the futuristic Escape From Absolom (1994) to the swashbuckling Mask of Zorro (1998), has proven himself one of the least imaginative blockbuster directors in the business. His handling of action remains competent yet doggedly literal, moving straight ahead while covering all the angles: no shaky camera work or confusingly fast cutting for him.
Presumably under orders to render the franchise more edgy and sexy, Campbell eliminates most of the gadgetry associated with Bond and ramps up the brutal realism, but only to a point. In the earliest (and best) set-piece, even the semi-anonymous thug whom Bond pursues up and down a dusty Madagascar construction site proves capable of impossibly death-defying leaps.
Back from his busman's holiday, Bond is reproved by his overseer M  once again played by Judi Dench  in the manner of a firm headmistress faced with a sullenly cheeky pupil. Then it's off to the Bahamas, where Bond's first conquest Solange (Caterina Murino) shows up riding a white horse bareback along a beach while a native child gazes at her in awe.
As he demonstrated in his embarrassing Beyond Borders (2003), starring Angelina Jolie as a quiveringly noble Third World aid worker, Campbell's eye for local colour is as limited as his interest in geopolitics is slight. Fleming's novels, which gained popularity in the US after a personal endorsement from John F. Kennedy, are inescapably artifacts of the Cold War.
This time round, the villains are (naturally) terrorists, whose exact motivations are never specified. Other than a stray reference to September 11, Bond's jet-setting exploits take place in a world of fantasy, in which the fate of nations can somehow rest on a game of Texas Hold'em poker. Bond's chief opponent at the card table, Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelson), is conceived as one of the series' typical grotesque villains  fish-faced, flamboyantly asthmatic and prone to weeping tears of blood. But there isn't enough brio to his scheming: I kept expecting the film to pull back and reveal a still more outlandish figure pulling his strings.
Aiming to transform Bond from a faintly comic fop to a workable 21st century model of virility, the script gently kids the familiar but dated aspects of his persona: the flashy cars, the martinis, the corny quips.
At the same time, Craig represents a throwback to an earlier generation of ruggedly homely leading men: his emergence from the sea in a bathing suit triggers memories of Lee Marvin's incongruous beach romps in Point Blank (1967).
It would be stretching a point to suggest that the filmmakers have gone back to Fleming's original vision of Bond, who's cooler and more analytical than any of his movie counterparts: by choice a lone gunman and ruthless sybarite, almost a cousin to Patricia Highsmith's Ripley.
Basically, Craig's Bond is a new and individual creation. Cultivated without being civilised, he's less psychopathic than faintly autistic, or even childlike. (There's a moment when he's injected by his minders with a high-tech tracking device, and he says, very plainly: ""Ow"".) More than any earlier version of the character, he's unambiguously not a gentleman: his ability to turn on the charm is a tool of his trade  like computer hacking or marksmanship, not touching the essential man.
Mostly, his mind appears to be subordinate to his instincts: his real secret weapons are his diamond-blue eyes and muscular torso, showed off from the outset and taking centre stage in a horrific torture scene that for once allows him to earn his heroic status through suffering.
This Bond isn't much of a wit, and he's also capable of undignified emotions: vanity, petulance, even a certain primal tenderness. The love story in Casino Royale never becomes as central as it should: in the role of Bond's colleague Vesper Lynd, the pert and pretty Eva Green doesn't do enough to indicate why she, above all other women, should capture his heart.
Yet the scene where he comforts a distraught Vesper in their hotel room has an intimacy unimaginable in any previous Bond film. The surprising gesture that Craig makes here is, surely, an actor's choice, and one that comes close to converting a tacky power fantasy into something more rich and strange.

Casino Royale, directed by Martin Campbell, screenplay by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, based on the novel by Ian Fleming
The James Bond films have been with us for more than 40 years, for better or worse. They are not so much a barometer of popular moods but of the thinking of a layer of mercenary film studio executives attempting to gauge or guess at popular moods.
Ian Fleming (1908-1964), who wrote the books on which the films were initially based, was a fairly unsavory character. The son of a Conservative Member of Parliament who died during World War I, Fleming worked for British naval intelligence in the Second World War and used some of this experience for his Bond novels. The first one, Casino Royale, appeared in 1953.
As numerous commentators have pointed out, James Bonds rise as a fantasy secret agent coincided with Britains actual decline as a world power during the postwar era. In Flemings fiction, however, the cool and collected Briton outthought, outfought and outloved not only his Soviet opponents, but also his American allies.
The Bond novels were vaguely risqu in their time (Flemings wife called them Ians pornography), with hints of unusual sexual activity. Many adolescent boys were drawn to them in the less permissive atmosphere of the early 1960s. A number of the female characters are lesbians and have to be returned to normalcy by Bond. The relationships are generally of the dominator-dominated variety. In The Spy Who Loved Me, Flemings narrator, a woman, explains: All women love semi-rape. They love to be taken. It was his sweet brutality against my bruised body that made his act of love so piercingly wonderful. That and the coinciding of nerves so completely relaxed after the removal of tension and danger, the warmth of gratitude, and a womans natural feeling. Ayn Rand was a big admirer, unsurprisingly.
Umberto Eco, in a 1979 work, pointed to a number of binary oppositions that defined the Bond novels: positive values and features (Free World, Great Britain, Western civilization, sacrifice, duty, willingness to undergo pain, loyalty, physical attractiveness) associated with the secret agent and negative ones (Soviet Union, foreignness, physical deformity, luxury, excess, perversion, disloyalty) attached to the enemy. Eco commented: Bond represents beauty and virility as opposed to the Villain, who often appears monstrous and sexually impotent. Racism and national chauvinism abound in Fleming, along with other unpleasant attitudes.
There have been 21 official Bond films directed by nine different, mostly British and mostly unremarkable filmmakers; another was born in Canada, but raised in England (Roger Spottiswoode); and two more come from New Zealand (Lee Tamahori, who has a Maori father and British mother, and Martin Campbell, the director of the current film). In his The American Cinema, Andrew Sarris noted that Terence Young (Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Thunderball) had done the best of the Bonds, but that his overall career was staggeringly undistinguished. The individual, John Glen, who directed the most Bond films (five), oddly enough, hardly made anything else.
It would be a mistake to become overly nostalgic about the early films. Even at the time, they were compared unfavorably to other efforts in the spy genre. Sarris, for example, in 1965, contrasted Sean Connery, the first Bond, to Michael Caine in Sidney Furies The Ipcress File. He wrote that Caine was a more attractive performer than Connery and suggested that Caines character was more comically accessible to audiences than Connerys. Caines success with women is more plausible than that of his predecessor largely because Caines banter sounds more knowing. Connerys conquests seem to reflect the triumph of wardrobe over wit, and his women almost invariably succumb with the spontaneity of mechanical dolls in some future interplanetary convention of department-store buyers.
In Dr. No, Joseph Wiseman as the villain and Ursula Andress, as the love interest, stand out; in Goldfinger, one remembers the German actor Gert Frbe and Honor Blackman. Connery had some suave and sophisticated moments. A great deal of the rest is silence. In recent decades, the series has more or less turned into a parody of itself, sometimes deliberately, as the special effects and weaponry have pushed everything else into the background.
Flemings Casino Royale is an implausible Cold War tale. In the novel, Le Chiffre is a French Communist and agent for the Soviet assassination bureau SMERSH, who is presiding over a baccarat game in Monte Carlo in an effort to raise the 50 million francs in KGB funds he lost running a string of brothels! Bond, the best card player in the British secret service, is assigned to play Le Chiffre and beat him, thus provoking his employers to murder him. Bond is assisted by Vesper Lynd, with whom he falls madly in love, as well as an American CIA agent. Betrayals and double-crosses lie in store for 007.
In the new film, the first version of Flemings Casino Royale (the 1967 film, with David Niven and a host of others, was a spoof), Bond (Daniel Craig) has only recently gained his license to kill, by murdering his second victim (whose violent death in a public bathroom we witness during the pre-credits). Then, inexplicably, Bond is on the trail of a bombmaker in Madagascar. An extended chase ensues, followed by an explosion. Contrary to instructions, Bond heads for the Bahamas and eventually Miami, where he foils a plot to blow up a new jetliner.
Meanwhile, Le Chiffre (Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen), who, naturally, is a banker for terrorists in Campbells film, has invested $100 million for an African terrorist on the assumption that the jetliner will be blown up and its manufacturer ruined. Now his angry clients want their money back, and he plans to win it back playing baccarat at a casino in Montenegro. Bond is supplied with $10 million of the British governments money, and an assistant, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), in an effort to foil him.
If Bond films indicate something about the mood of those who commission, organize and shoot them (and perhaps wider circles than that), what does Casino Royale tell us? At the time of Daniel Craigs hiring as Bond (following Connery, Roger Moore, George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan), director Campbell promised something definitely darker, more character, less gadgets.
There are fewer weapons and explosions in Campbells work (although the lengthy chase scenes are tedious), and the mood is definitely more somber. The film is oddly spasmodic, fragmented and without any real center, geographical or moral. The headquarters of Bonds agency, which played a considerable and reassuring role in many of the early films, is gone, replaced by an anonymous apartment (belonging to M [Judi Dench], Bonds boss) in Londons Canary Wharf district. The villains are not terrorists in any meaningful political sensein fact, its entirely unclear who and what they are. The leading participants in the events of the films last few minutes are virtually unknown to us, and die or disappear before they make their presence felt dramatically.
The tone and rhythm of Casino Royale are deeply inconsistent. Not certain in which direction to proceed, the filmmakers, one senses, try various approaches. Scenes of genuinely sadistic, realistic violence alternate with idyllic sequences set in the Bahamas, Italys Lake Como, Venice and various locales in the Czech Republic (which for some reason stands in for Montenegro) and efforts at creating character.
The relationship between Bond and Vesper is accorded a few minutes. While we are told they are mad for each other, little of the emotional or physical chemistry that would convince us makes its way to the screen. And Green and Craig are burdened, more or less out of the blue, with lines like this: If the only thing left of you was your smile and your little finger, youd still be more of a man than anyone Ive ever met and I have no armour left. Youve stripped it from me. Whatever is left of mewhatever I amIm yours.
Aside from a few moments reclining with Vesper, Bond here is oddly machine-like, almost robotic. He moves rapidly, hurling himself from one point to the next. Connerys Bond had some of the swaggering, almost lazy self-assurance of the Cold War democracies; Crag is nervous, unhappy, isolated. Some of this feels appropriate to the historical moment, but the psychological changes in the character have not been worked through; they seem to have evolved more or less arbitrarily and accidentally.
The sadistic violence is troubling. Here too the filmmakers, albeit unconsciously, are attuned to the dark and frustrated moods of certain social layers. The film opens with Bond beating a man half to death and nearly concludes with his own brutal torture. The early Bond films, including their fight scenes, were utterly unreal and artificial, quasi-comical. In essence, very little of that unreality has been addressed in the new Casino Royale (the politics are far more skewed and fanciful, in fact), except in the increased intensity and duration of the violence. Whereas events, including the love story, generally proceed rather quickly, the filmmakers slow down to devote a considerable amount of time, lovingly, to the torture scene in particular, during which Bond is strapped naked to a chair. There is nothing healthy in that.
It is especially ironic that the terrorists, or at least their agent, should be carrying out acts of sexual torture. As we know, the American and British military and intelligence forces, and their allies, are the leading experts in this field. In the end, this is what makes a realistic Bond an oxymoron. Insofar as a Bond film comes into contact with social and historical facts, it must turn them on their head, losing any of its charm in the process.
Aside from a few entertaining and adventurous moments, and the lovely settings, there is very little to Casino Royale. And what there is, disturbs.

The introduction of a new James Bond always brings skepticism, and one of the major problems of Bond's 21st official cinematic adventure is that the skepticism remains when the final credits roll. Some will pick on the easy target: Daniel Craig, the new physical incarnation of Bond. Craig, a blond-haired, blue-eyed Brit, is not the type we typically associate with 007, and backlash against his casting sprang immediately upon his connection to the role. Honestly, it's petty, since it's what he does with role that's important, not how he looks. Craig is actually a great choice for the new Bond persona of Casino Royale; it's the new spin on the character from screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis that leaves doubts. Their Bond is more low-rent thug than suave cosmopolitanmore government assassin than super spy. He is, essentially, without personality, and it is to Craig's credit that he tries his best to instill some charm into a charmless role. Since the movie is an obvious attempt to restart the franchise from the beginning (actually using Ian Fleming's first Bond novel as its inspiration) and the character is just starting to develop, the decision makes sense, but the movie suffers because of it nonetheless.
The movie opens with Bond acquiring his ""00"" status by killing two men. Somewhere in Africa, a man with one useful eye named Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) takes some money from so-called freedom fighters. Bond, meanwhile, is in Madagascar, tracking down terrorist Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) to retrieve information from him. After an extended chase that leads him to kill Mollaka and blow up part of a foreign embassy, Bond is obviously not on MI6 leader M's (Judi Dench) best side. Bond decides to decipher information retrieved from the terrorist on his own and makes his way to the Bahamas as a rogue agent. There Bond finds Alex Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian), who helps with the execution of terrorist activities, and his wife Solange (Caterina Murino).. After some wooing of Solange, Bond discovers Dimitrios' plans involving the destruction of a new jet airliner in Miami. That plan, of course, is thwarted by 007, and Bond is back slightly on M's good side, leading her to let him join a high-stakes, no-limit hold-'em poker game run by Le Chiffre at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. The catch: Bond must answer to the Treasury Department's liaison Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).
Clearly, a lot is happening in the plot, and as per usual, most of it makes little to no sense. Occasionally, the script's weaving and winding, double-cross-filled plot is frustrating and sloppy, especially when Bond seems to have an extrasensory knowledge of who the real villains are before any evidence arises. A good chunk of the story revolves around the poker game, and director Martin Campbell never achieves any worthwhile tension in these scenes. There's one of the movie's four action sequences, a chase in a stairwell, randomly thrown in the middle of the poker plot to spice things up, but it feels forced. The other action sequences fare much better. Instead of the gadget-heavy, exaggerated action to which we've become accustomed, the sequences here are based slightly more in reality. The lengthy chase in Madagascar succeeds the most, with Bond and Mollaka running and climbing up the steel of a construction site. Another has Bond hanging on for dear life to a truck rigged to explode as a terrorist attempts to knock him off. The climax is a shoot-out in a building collapsing into the canals of Venice, which provides an added dynamic to what could be pretty standard stuff.
Other than the story's weak points, there's also the problem that, while Le Chiffre has a creepy gimmick in the form of tear ducts that bleed, Bond's arch-nemesis finds himself at the mercy of other, lesser characters more than once. He's a generic villain and, at best, a mild threat to our hero. One distressing scene has Le Chiffre torturing Bond (it involves a nude Bond, strapped to a chair with no bottom, and a length of rope), and while it gives the villain a bit more menace, the scene is more intriguing for the fact that Bond shows inklings of masochism. The notion is one of the better character moments for a Bond who hardly talks, especially early in the movie, and it gives Craig one of many chances to allude to Bond's darker side. This brooding Bond is sometimes refreshing, but there might be too much of it here. It's a wise move to show Bond in love here to balance his character, and Eva Green is positively stunning in the role. Throughout the course of the movie, there are hints of the charismatic character we've become used to, but by the end, Bond seems to be on his way to a permanent stay in the shadows of his pain.
Where this new vision of the series is heading could have promise, and it's good this is not a prequel. A character like Bond should already be pretty well-defined after 20 movies, and an origin story is almost a trivial exercise, really. It doesn't have to be, of course, but that's what Casino Royale ultimately feels like.",ARR_Doc7_James_Bond_Casino_Royale_Review_Negative,Anish Randeria,Action,Negative,James Bond Casino Royale

Although box office has remained strong worldwide, even some of the most ardent fans of the James Bond series felt the series reached a creative low with the last two films starring Pierce Brosnan as 007, 1999's The World Is Not Enough and 2002's Die Another Day.  For me, though, the slump goes back to 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies, but that one seemed to go over better with Bond aficionados.
 
The last film I liked in the series was the first of the Brosnan Bonds, 1995's Goldeneye, which happens to be the last film original Bond producer Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli had any input on (although uncredited) in any shape or form.  But after Cubby died in 1996, the quality of the series headed south quickly despite remaining highly profitable.  Cubby was clearly the major creative force behind the Bond franchise who made it work.
 
All the subsequent Bond films after Cubby's death have been produced by his stepson, Michael G. Wilson, and his daughter, Barbara Broccoli, who both collaborated on several of the films with their father dating back to the late 1970s and early 1980s.  But with Cubby gone, the magic is gone as well.
 
Casino Royale was Ian Fleming's first 007 novel published in England back in 1953 and it was previously made into a god-awful 1967 all-star comedy spoof that went through five directors and 10 (not all credited) screenwriters, but also featured a great musical score by Burt Bacharach.  There is even an earlier TV version from 1954 (when the book was published in the U.S.) where actor Barry Nelson (the man who hands the keys to the Overlook Hotel to Jack Nicholson in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining) plays Jimmy Bond and Peter Lorre plays the villain.
 
Not counting the '67 comedy version of Casino Royale and 1983's Never Say Never Again, the new serious interpretation of Casino Royale is the 21st ""official"" James Bond film produced by EON Productions, the company Cubby co-founded with his production partner, Harry Saltzman, who left the series in 1975.
 
After the lackluster previous three Bond entries starring Brosnan, I had high hopes for the new Casino Royale because it was being billed as a ""grittier"" Bond film, and the last two times Bond ""returned to basics,"" it resulted in what are possibly my two favorites of the entire series, 1989's Licence to Kill and 1981's For Your Eyes Only.  Furthermore, Casino Royale had Martin Campbell returning to direct, and in my estimation, his first Bond film, Goldeneye, was the last enjoyable entry in the series.
 
Campbell's Casino Royale is indeed grittier, but unfortunately, it's only marginally better than the last three.  Unlike Licence to Kill and For Your Eyes Only, I think filmmakers got a little too down to earth for their own good this time, and, in turn, squeezed out a lot what's fun about these movies.  Licence to Kill and For Your Eyes Only had just the right balance of grit, wit and spectacular action.  The latest Bond, however, is overlong (its 144 minutes makes it the longest Bond to date), often sluggish and lacking in the kind of big, exciting action we've come to expect in Bond movies.
 
But on the plus side, Casino Royale contains no digital effects, which is refreshing after the previous two Bonds became overwhelmed with digital effects.
 
For those who thought Timothy Dalton's demeanor was too serious as Bond (I thought Dalton was just right for the role), Dalton is practically Roger Moore as compared to the latest Bond, blond-haired, blue-eyed Daniel Craig (Layer Cake, Infamous), who plays the role with a stone-faced intensity more reminiscent of Charles Bronson.  Craig, though, isn't the problem.  The problem is that he's the centerpiece of an inconsistently paced film that goes on way too long and doesn't have enough action or suspense.
 
Furthermore, the latest Bond theme song, ""You Know My Name"" by Chris Cornell, may very well be the most instantly forgettable in series history.
 
Since this is based on Fleming's first Bond novel, Casino Royale, like Batman Begins, is a return to the origins of the character in an attempt to revitalize a creaky franchise.  In the film, Craig's Bond has just recently been made a double 00 agent by his superior M (Judi Dench) and 007s first assignment is to neutralize a money launderer for terrorists named Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen).  Bond's mission takes him from Uganda to the Bahamas to Miami to the Balkan States to Venice as he tracks the one-eyed, asthmatic, and, of course, sadistic Le Chiffre.
 
After joining forces with a fellow British agent (and eventual love interest) named Vesper Lynd (Eva Green of Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers), Bond and Le Chiffre finally come face to face during an international poker game where the British government stakes Bond in an attempt to bankrupt Le Chiffre by having Bond beat him at the gambling table.  This is also where Bond first meets his future long term CIA friend and contact Felix Leiter (played here by Jeffrey Wright) and gets introduced to what will become his signature drink, a martini, shaken not stirred.
 
It not until the very end that we first hear 007 utter his famous, ""Bond, James Bond"" line, and not until the end credits that we hear Bond's famous theme music.
 
Casino Royale has a couple of decent chase sequences, and Craig does have a strong screen presence, but just like the Cornell's theme song, most of what happens is instantly forgettable and nothing we haven't seen before.
 
From the results of EONs last four Bond films, this is clearly a worn-out franchise ready to be put out to pasture.  The man with the license to kill has become the man with the license to bore.

Give or take the odd Octopussy, I suppose, like all of us, I've pretty much seen them all. My first, memorably - you never forget your first - was a rerun of Thunderball at a Gaumont in Birmingham, which in my memory was in the process of being demolished. I'd have been eight, and the most dramatic big screen extravanganza I'd seen previously was Swiss Family Robinson, so Bond came with something of the force of revelation; I went home to re-enact Sean Connery's underwater fight with Largo's men with a single rubber-suited Action Man in the bath.
My first on its proper release, not long after, was The Man with The Golden Gun, complete with Lulu's soundtrack. I had nightmares for a while about Christopher Lee's Scaramanga, and recall trying to join in with playground discussions about the voluptuous merits of Britt Eklund's Mary Goodnight in relation to Pussy Galore, a name whose reference was possibly still beyond me. I was, in any case, hooked, for a long time secretly thinking Roger Moore was the best Bond, a fact which would have dismayed my Dad who properly held out for the more spartan virtues of Sean Connery, and my Mum, who would sometimes make an impassioned, slightly flushed argument for the missed opportunity that was George Lazenby.
Anyhow, with some of this in mind, I went along to the Odeon Leicester Square on Friday night for the first screening of the new Bond, the Daniel Craig Bond. Most of the other balding, paunchy one-timeschoolboys in the queue seemed to have a similar not quite cynical sense of expectation. There'd be chases, and gadgets and gags - the last Bond line I'd heard in the cinema, was also one of the best: Pierce Brosnan, on the Bosphorus with Dr Christmas Jones at the end of The World is not Enough: 'I've always wanted to have Christmas in Turkey.'
Hopes were high. If nothing else, there would be John Barry's theme, which, as I joined the line to have my mobile phone confiscated - an emasculation I could never imagine 007 submitting to - was already dun-de-dunning in my head. The word before this screening was that Daniel Craig's Bond would be a purist's Bond, dirtier and grittier than recent smoothies. Casino Royale was the first of Fleming's books, and the only one, for contractual reasons, never previously filmed except in the Peter Sellers spoof. It would return James to his roots, the cold-blooded killer, the ex-wartime Commander, before fast women and invisible cars turned his head. It begins, after a title sequence involving the designs on the back of playing cards, and diamonds coming out of guns and writhing croupiers in silhouette - you know - in exactly that retro spirit, apparently in black and white, in Prague: Bond is in the shadows surprising a double agent rifling through a filing cabinet. Craig had effectively auditioned for Bond in Layer Cake, in which he played a cocaine dealer out of his depth, and we cut to what looks like a scene from that film - the very un-Bond-like graphic violence of Craig murdering an informer in a white-tiled public lavatory, holding the man's head underwater in a cheap sink. This, we are led to understand, was Bond's first kill, the most traumatic, his 007 status still pending, before the quips set in. His second, of the double agent by the filing cabinet, with a silencer, is more straightforward, and prompts a wry smile.
That grainy preamble over, Craig is in colour and up and running - straight through a staged cobra and mongoose fight in a market in Madagascar, over the odd trashed car, past plenty of startled villagers carrying unlikely dry goods, up some serious scaffolding scattering hard-hatted building workers, and on to a crane tower over the impossibly blue ocean in pursuit of a scar-faced villain with a bag of explosives. Who wants backstreet grittiness when you can have fights with guns that run out of bullets at opportune moments at high altitude?
Craig is the first Bond since Connery who looks more than capable of doing his own stunts, he runs like a streetfighter, falls credibly from great heights and has been practising his free running. This is pre-Q Bond; the closest he gets to a gadget is a decent mobile phone; he spends a good deal of his time chasing fast cars on foot in a manner Roger Moore would have deemed far too keen; to start with he doesn't even seem to have his own motor. Worse still, he hasn't yet earned Barry's theme, except in odd mangled chords.
The best preface to Casino Royale is Simon Winder's wonderful book The Man Who Saved Britain, out in paperback to coincide with the release of the film. It's the comic history of an obsession with Bond, both his own and our own - an unravelling of all the curious hang-ups about posh drinks and hat-throwing and casual misogyny that takes in the demise of imperial ambition, post-war austerity and Fleming's taste for torture. It's a brilliant deconstruction of those staples of British life that Paul Johnson, writing long ago of Bond in the New Statesmen, denounced as 'sex, snobbery and sadism', (this before Johnson moved to the Spectator and discovered the pleasures of the same).
You rather wish Cubby Broccoli and the rest had studied Winder's memoir before embarking on Casino Royale. One of the things his book argues well is that the explosion of a gas tanker is no real substitute for vaguely plausible plotting or some notion of contemporary relevance - a key element in Fleming's thrillers was his sharp move from villainous former Nazis, to Cold War paranoia.
In attempting to flesh out the idea of Daniel Craig's Bond as backstory to subsequent Bonds - trying on his first dinner jacket for size, tripping over his chat-up lines to Eva Green's gorgeous Vesper Lynd, replying when asked if he wants his martini shaken or stirred, 'Do I look like I give a damn?' - almost everything else seems to have gone out of the window (along with various not particularly sinister villains).
I'm quite happy for Bond to live in a continuous present, but the time frame of the film is perplexing. After the grainy Fifties Prague opening, there is the predictable Seventies, Whicker's World rush of destinations, taking in Uganda, Madagascar, the Bahamas and Venice, while Bond, who we are presumably supposed to believe we have never come across before, suggests from time to time that he is in 2006. Judi Dench as M, seems more than usually unsure about the wisdom of her role or which era she's in. She speaks at one point of her nostalgia for the Cold War, before outlining the plot, such as it is, which involves an attempt to manipulate the stock market using terrorism, bringing in the first and only reference to 9/11. You don't expect Casino Royale to be 24, quite, or Bond to be Jack Bauer, but it seems bizarre to be employing a mix of Albanian and Swiss and African and Italian financial terrorists when you might think there are more real current fears to explore.
Director Martin Campbell is also unsure about how much of the glamour of violence he wants to strip back. There are unusual 007 moments in which Bond lets us know he's human, sitting soaking in the shower in his blood-drenched dinner suit comforting Vesper after she has helped him kill a man; or, oddly, screaming in pain. Raymond Chandler praised the original book of Casino Royale for its brutal description of torture, exposing genre-fiction to a new realism. The scene that Chandler singled out is reproduced here, with Bond tied naked on the frame of a chair while his exposed scrotum is whipped with a knotted rope. Craig is, not surprisingly, in more obvious pain than any previous Bond , but having put him there, the only way to remove him is through a comically unexplained ambush; by the next scene, like the Bonds of old, he is recuperating by the Italian lakes, his tenderized tackle magically restored.
The problem with making Bond more real, is that everything around him then seems even more fake than usual. Craig, always a charismatic presence, often looks unsettled by that dislocation; his sex scenes are more energetic than those of his predecessors but even less convincing; he is hardly allowed any comedy. As a result, by the end of a curiously back-to-front film, when he finally gets his theme tune and introduces himself - 'Bond. James Bond' - he, like the creaky franchise itself, seems profoundly unsure whether he is coming or going.
What the other critics thought of Casino Royale 
Daniel Craig is brilliant, oozing the kind of edgy menace that recalls Sean Connery at his best. It's everything that makes Bond Britain's finest cinematic export - slick, fast-moving and pulse-poundingly exciting. The best since GoldenEye 
David Edwards, Mirror Film Critic
Casino Royale takes us back to basics. To a leaner production and to a Bond who looks like he can do serious damage. Craig is up there with the best. His sex appeal is off the scale. The stunts are more physical and the violence raw. 
Wendy Ide, The Times
Craig's Bond has been rebooted as a man not quite secure within his own tuxedo and the result is a nervier epic. It could have been off-puttingly dark but Craig holds the screen: When this Bond laughs there is a sense of relief. 
Sinclair McKay, The Telegraph
Running at two hours and 20 minutes, the movie is too long. But you can bet on Craig being a hit because when he sorts out his enemy at the end of the film - with his well-worn line 'Bond - James Bond', you just can't help cheering.

20,AZ_Doc10_pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl,"If there was a minor quibble with the movie, it is that it is a little overlong. Putting that aside, this is a truly wonderful film, that is definitely one of the highlights of 2003. The whole film is a wonder to look at, with splendid costumes and very realistic sets. The script is just a gem, with classic and original lines like ""Stop blowing holes in my ship,"" that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate, especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming, likable rogue, and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role, sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas, because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off, I want to mention another aspect of the film, the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers, like James Horner(American Tail, Titanic), John Williams(ET, Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend, The Shadow) All in all, a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox.
I absolutely love this movie. Johnny brings Captain Jack Sparrow to life and with hilarious, swashbuckling genius. The special effects, sword fighting and action are astounding. Not too violent, scary or koochy koo, so from little uns to the elderly can enjoy!
Ok but after many years of watching this movie and absolutely loving it i came here to leave a review . The directing is just incredible with the best soundtracks . Acting by Johnny depp is of course one of the highlights of his career and his skills are amazing . You can tell how passionate he is . I feel like this movie has affected everyone's childhood in a good way and was enjoyed by everyone . Who doesnt love it
It's impossible to deny that the first Pirates of the Caribbean is a brilliant film. Is it for kids? Not sure, maybe, but it's something that everyone can enjoy.
The story unfolds perfectly across the film, giving rhyme and reason to every character. Insofar as a pirate film can be, it is quite an intelligent plot! Characters each have their strengths and mix together really well. Funny, excitig, with some decent choreography throughout as well. Visually it's impressive for the most part, the CGI at times shows it age (despite not being too old), and design is perfect.
It's Depp at his best, and probably the most iconic of his 'weird' characters. Knightley can get irritating but that is probably more from character than anything else. Bloom very much plays a Bloom character, but that isnt so bad. All secondary characters flesh out the story and have excellent interactions due to a witty script.
Everyone can enjoy this. Can you say that for the subsequently franchise? Probably not, but the original stands strong.",AZ_Doc10_pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl,Alex Zhou,Action,Positive,"Pirates of the Caribbean, the curse of the black pearl"
21,AZ_Doc1_pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl,"Were it not for Johnny Depp's crassly reassured character creation of scoundrel pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, there would be nothing to relish in this overlong and witless waste of celluloid. The movie is based on a Disneyland ride. Captain Jack hijacks the fastest ship in the British fleet to rescue kidnapped damsel-in-distress Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) from the clutches of Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Barbossa has also purloined Sparrow's newly haunted ship The Black Pearl. In addition, Barbossa has stolen a cursed treasure, transforming himself and his crew into a band of pirate zombies who must now attempt to break the hex with the blood of Elizabeth's sappy suitor, a blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Gore Verbinksi (""The Ring"") directs this slapdash pileup of unlikable characters and pointless fencing duels, set against a backdrop of labored horror.
Jerry Bruckheimer is a name that consistently signals big budget, feature length movie trailers. He has become the brand name producer of attention deficit disorder movies. It doesn't matter how many times you get up to go to the bathroom during ""The Rock,"" ""Armageddon,"" or ""Black Hawk Down"" because you'll never miss anything important in stories that are spread out like spoonfuls of peanut butter over a two-mile stretch of hot asphalt. The fact that the producer of grand scale fiascoes like ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Kangaroo Jack"" is stuck at the hip to Disney studios is apropos for a brand of cheesy entertainment that would be better served if it donated the money it wastes making movies to the American educational system.
""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a conundrum of impotent cinematic entertainment elements crushed together into a vat of barren atmosphere. On one hand, it's a children's pirate movie that savors spoken references to ""scalawags"" and ""Davey Jones' Locker"" beneath interminable sword fights. On the other hand, it's a violent and lackluster pastiche of silly visual mumbo jumbo that comes off as a bad joke carried too far. Either way, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is too extreme for very young audiences, yet not developed enough for adults to enjoy.
Unsurprisingly, it's Johnny Depp who does his best to single-handedly unify the film's narrative quagmire by pulling focus and tweaking his relationship to the forth wall. Depp is never less than tongue-in-cheek in his slippery relationship to other characters or to the camera-as-audience. He ever so slightly mocks each line of dialogue and action set piece equally from behind a dubious choice of heavy eyeliner make-up that seems self-rendered. For the role of Sparrow, Depp adopts a perpetually drunken demeanor that gives his scenes an array of comedy lacking from the movie's severely disjointed  tone. The film feels like it was directed by committee, with Johnny Depp left alone to lend whatever character cohesion there is.

22,AZ_Doc2_pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl,"Despite decent action, Pirates jumps into flawed deep end. Fans of the swashbuckling epics will be happy to know that Pirates of the Caribbean evokes memories of the dying genre. And while the film has plenty of action that works, it eventually succumbs to overkill in a heavily padded, 2:15 running time. The film centers around a cursed gold medallion that initially comes in contact with a young pirate Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). When Turner, who doesn't know he's a pirate, is rescued by a British fleet led by Gov. Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), the medallion is taken by Swann's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), to conceal Turners true identity from her father, keeping Turner safe. Eight years later, the crew of the ship, the Black Pearl, led by Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), comes after the medallion, which holds the key to breaking the crews cursed existence. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth and Turner enlists the aid of a rogue pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to rescue the young maiden. From the moment Depp appears on camera, there's a certain charm in the actors swagger. Depp plays Sparrow like a cross between Val Kilmer in The Doors and Dudley Moore in Arthur, and watching his performance is a lot of fun. Bloom makes for a good young hero, while Knightley is a major find as the young heroine. Even Rush appears to be having a lot of fun as the evil Barbossa. Director Gore Verbinski stages some visually spectacular action sequences, while Ted Elliott and Terry Rossios screenplay clearly doesn't take itself too seriously. Unfortunately, all of the films good will is eventually washed away in a mammoth running time that definitely bogs down the fun. The film could have easily wrapped up in 90 minutes, yet it stumbles on with several action sequences that are essentially repeats of earlier scenes. There's always too much going on, which is easily forgivable for a while. But as the minutes mount, the flaws are only accentuated. Like his previous film, the superior The Ring, Verbinski just doesn't seem to understand when enough is enough. Pirates of the Caribbean holds the distinction as being the first film to be released with a PG-13 rating under the Walt Disney Picture label. That distinction will probably be the only thing that this near miss will be remembered for. In an already-crowded summer action field, Pirates proves to be its own worst enemy. After Caribbean, sportswriter/movie reviewer Michael Compton is feeling a little seasick.
This is apparently a big hit if you judge by numbers.  The only way I can explain this is to postulate that watching this after sitting through Charlies Angels: Full Throttle, Legally Blonde 2, and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is akin to the relief you feel when someone stops hitting you over the head with a hammer and starts pinching you.  Its good only in comparison with what came before.",AZ_Doc2_pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl,Alex Zhou,Action,Negative,"Pirates of the Caribbean, the curse of the black pearl"
23,AZ_Doc3_pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl,"It is going to be very difficult to avoid dedicating the entire review of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" to Johnny Depp. How many actors could save an otherwise average, overlong pirate movie from utter tedium? Mr. Depp, channeling Tyrone Power through a filter of Dudley Moore, creates a character so peculiar that you're hanging on his every line reading. Somehow, Mr. Depp manages to walk the line between eccentricity and absurdity in every scene and it is this balancing act, rather than the sizable CGI effects budget, that keeps ""Pirates"" from sinking in its own ham-handedness.
That's not to say that the CGI effects are bad. In order to support a plot that involves a ghost ship full of men who are revealed as undead skeletons in the moonlight, director Gore Verbinski and his crew have a lot of fun with clouds and well-placed shafts of light. The effect is flawless though a bit overused. Of course, there's no getting around the fact that CGI skeletons are just not very menacing. It's hard to take them seriously; talking mouths without lips just look silly. And since much is made of the fact that Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush, also excellent as a good old-fashioned ""Arrr!"" pirate) and the cursed crew of the Black Pearl cannot be killed, the protracted fight scenes hold very little interest. Only occasionally do the protagonists find interesting ways to dispatch the skeleton crew, otherwise it's more or less a series of drawn-out, one-sided fights.
The one genuinely exciting swashbuckling sequence comes early on between Mr. Depp's Captain Jack and Orlando Bloom's stalwart Will Turner. As they jump from rafter to rafter in a blacksmith's shop, the two men seem evenly matched and there is actually something at stake. The scene also results in the film's one truly excellent line of dialogue, as Will is aghast at Sparrow's less-than-fair fighting technique. Sparrow's reply: ""Pirate.""
The biggest problem with the film is its length. All I can think is that Mr. Verbinski got greedy. The film should have been as quick and breezy as the Disney attraction on which it's based. Instead, the director and some members of the cast treat the material with a reverence that nearly sinks it. The script, credited to no less than four writers, is not an epic. ""Pirates"" is one of those Hollywood history pieces that seems to have gotten its historical facts from past Hollywood pirate movies. All the elements are in place: the ship-to-ship battles, the plank-walking, the damsel in distress. The bonny lass in question is Keira Knightley who played Queen Amidala's double in ""Star Wars: Episode I"". This being a period piece, Ms. Knightley turns down the Portman and turns up the Winona as Elizabeth Swann, the comely object of Will's obsession. Like her more experienced doppelgangers, Ms. Knightley mistakes over-enunciation for acting. This is not a problem for Captain Jack, whose drunken moments can hardly be distinguished from the sober ones. Oops, there I go again talking about Johnny Depp. Get used to that. He's all you'll remember from the movie.",AZ_Doc3_pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl,Alex Zhou,Action,Negative,"Pirates of the Caribbean, the curse of the black pearl"
24,AZ_Doc4_pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl,"If you think the title is long, wait until you see the movie.  At two hours, 23 minutes running time, a good guy captured by pirates should pray for a plank to walk thats this long.  Gone with the Wind, which covered the Civil War and its aftermath, was only 55 minutes longer. Although you might find it hard to believe as youre sitting through it, it does end eventually, and the proof is that I am actually sitting here writing this review.
Johnny Depp plays a constantly inebriated pirate captain in this tongue-in-cheek sendup of pirate movies. Did we really need a sendup of pirate movies?  Whens the last time you saw one? Hollywood has nothing better to do than spoof a genre thats been dead for fifty years?
And, please, if youre going to do a spoof, make it intelligent.  People it with good actors.  Give it a good script.  Give it a story, for heavens sake.  Alas, Disney/Jerry Bruckheimer did none of these.  Oh, there are a couple of guys, Geoffrey Rush, who plays the dastardly Captain Barbossa, and another guy, who do pale imitations of Robert Newton as Long John Silver in Treasure Island, circa 1950, the quintessential cinematic pirate.  But, like this movie, they fall way, way short of Newtons genius. 
In the unlikely event that you still want to see this, I wont ruin it for you by telling the story. Its all pretty silly, but thats OK because this is a farce (and I dont use that as a term of opprobrium; its meant to be a farce). But I will warn you that, except for Depp and Rush, the actings mediocre at best.  Keira Knightly, who did a workmanlike job in Bend it Like Beckham is mightily miscast here as the gorgeous damsel in distress, Elizabeth Swann.  Shes not gorgeous enough.  And the lines shes given would put any actress to the test.  Depps besotted Captain Sparrow starts out humorous, but finally becomes tiresome.  Im also offended by vacuous filmmakers who think its funny to show the harmless drunk.  Alcoholism is no joke, folks, and movies like this (and the worst of the loveable drunk genre, Arthur) trivialize a serious problem.  Hollywood, however, loves drugs; youre not gonna breathe much if you hold your breath until Hollywood takes a stand against drug use.  Even though we dont see him taking a drink until near the longed-for end, Sparrows constantly drunk, even when hes locked away in jail.
This has a lot of mindless violence.  But thats what you would expect in a pirate movie. Here people keep fighting dead people who cant be killed. They knew they were dead going in. And the fights take up about the last seven hours of the movie. One fight after another between a man and a skeleton.  Then theres a fight between two skeletons. There apparently arent any Basil Rathbones left in Hollywood because all the sword fighting is shot with Chicago-like quick cuts so you cant see if any of these hunks can actually handle a sword.

25,AZ_Doc5_pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl,"It brings me little joy to write the following review of what I consider an entertaining but ultimately lackluster film, since it was based on one of my two all-time favorite Disneyland rides growing up (the other being the Haunted Mansion, which has also been made into a movie that will probably be far less enjoyable than this one).
Pirates of the Caribbean is not a bad film. In fact, it's a better than average film. But it's not a film I could watch repeatedly. Rather disappointing, after the way director Gore Verbinski kicked our asses with The Ring last year. There is a lot to like here, and plenty to keep you watching, with the two main stars of the film being some fantastic visuals and Johnny Depp's performance (which is the saving grace many times over).
However, much of what lies between action scenes or Depp's near-brilliant lunacy in the role of Captain Jack Sparrow is just so much plodding, formulaic filler. To be sure, Depp has some comedic moments that are priceless here. It's just too bad he didn't have enough to fill up all of the film's overlong 134 minute running time.
The plot, in a nutshell, is that a band of undead cursed pirates are lead by Geoffery Rush. They are after a missing coin that must be returned to its chest with an accompanying blood ritual in order to lift the curse. The gorgeous aristocrat's daughter Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) posesses the coin. The Pirates take it, and her, back to the island to perform the ritual. Her unrequited-as-of-yet lover Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) follows with the intent to rescue her, having enlisted the aid of the cunning, hilarious, and slightly insane pirate Jack Sparrow.
However, many of the comedic moments are flat and uninspired, and while Knightley and Bloom certainly look pretty and can swash buckles well enough, I can't recall a more bland pairing of hero and heroine.
There are a few nice nods to the ride that fans will get and enjoy - like the prisoners trying to use a bone to coax the dog holding the jail cell keys in its mouth. But was there any real reason that such a simplistic tale of a pirate curse, with the standard revenge and romance subplots, needed to go on for over two hours? About as much reason as a movie like Bad Boys 2 needs to hit the 2:15 mark. Every director thinks they're an auteur these days. Here's an idea, make a little more use of the editing room, then use the plethora of deleted scenes to come out with a nice, fat 2 (or 4) disc set that can further glorify the Disney coffers.
Is it watchable summer entertainment? surely. Is it more enjoyable than not? A fair assessment. But is it anything about it that renders it a classic? Sadly, no. If I see the sure-to-be-released PIRATES OF THE CARRIBBEAN 2 for any reason, it will be for more of Jack Sparrow's posturing and scheming.",AZ_Doc5_pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl,Alex Zhou,Action,Negative,"Pirates of the Caribbean, the curse of the black pearl"
26,AZ_Doc6_pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl,"Is there an actor working today the camera loves more than Johnny Depp?  I don't think so. Even with his ridiculous unkempt appearance as the roguish Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, I wanted him to be in every scene. Although this adventure flick disappointed me in terms of its ghost-ridden plot and over-the-top action sequences, I found it worth seeing because of Depp's extraordinary efforts to create another memorable screen character. And he succeeds with flying colors: Jack Sparrow is every bit as unforgettable as Depp's squeamish Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow.  
""It was a different kind of role for me,"" Depp declared. ""It was a great opportunity to invent this pirate from the ground up, to create a different kind of pirate than you have seen before.""
The filmmakers wisely gave Depp the freedom to do what he wanted in developing Jack Sparrow's persona. ""We just let him go and he came up with this off-center, yet very shrewd pirate,"" explained producer Jerry Bruckheimer.  ""He can't quite hold his balance, his speech is a bit slurred, so you assume he's either drunk, seasick or he's been on a ship too long. But it's all an act perpetrated for effect. And, strange as it seems, it's also part of Captain Jack's charm.""
Depp claims he modeled Sparrow after Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards -- because ""Pirates were the rock stars of their day."" He also admits throwing a bit of Pepe Le Pew, the cartoon character, into the mix.  
Depp's unique creation emerges as man with a mischievous nature and an optimistic outlook. No matter how many bad things happen to Captain Jack, he continues on his mission to find his ship, the Black Pearl. He's determined to get it back from the scoundrels who took it from him. Depp describes Jack as ""a guy who was able to run between the raindrops. . . . He can walk across the DMZ, entertain a troop and then sashay back to the other side and tell the enemy another story. He tries to stay on everyone's good side because he's wise enough to know he might need them in the future.""
There are commentaries by Verbinski, Depp and Bruckheimer as well as a feature titled ""An Epic at Sea: The Making of Pirates of the Caribbean,"" an interactive history of pirates called ""Below Deck,"" and a blooper reel. 
Outstanding movie! Depp was absolutely perfect for this role, as was Orlando Bloom. All ages will enjoy it; not too intense for children, and not too silly for adults. Highly recommend!
Love all the characters, not only the leads but also all the ship's crew. The background of the story was very simple actually, but they successfully turned it out into a beautiful one. Cannot stop laughing for all those sily scenes. Such an amazing movie to start off the franchise!!! The overall cast made the movie even better! Such a great storyline filled with lots of action, laughter, & a blossoming love story.",AZ_Doc6_pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl,Alex Zhou,Action,Positive,"Pirates of the Caribbean, the curse of the black pearl"

Yer timbers are about to get shivered, yer sails hoisted, yer plank walked. It's all here, with swagger and panache and a little of the supernatural thrown in. For what's a pirate without a curse?
This film is the epitome of a solid action-filled adventure. It has a straightforward and fast-paced plot that drags you in, propelled by a charming lead, witty jokes and compelling special effects. It roars along with gusto and thrills the audience from beginning to end.
Though Johnny Depp doesn't get the girl, he rules the roost... and the mainsails, the bilges, the seas, all hands on deck and all challenges on land. While he effects a slurry speech that makes him seem high on an undisclosed organic substance, (he claims to have based his character's style on Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards), he doesn't quite take it beyond rascally good fun and an entertainment level Disney can bank on.
Keira Knightly enchants us with her totally spunky parent-defying audacity in a career-making roll following the promise of her recent outing in ""Bend it Like Beckham"". Geoffrey Rush earns a medal of merit for chaining his larger than life Barbossa to credible limits of hissable evil conduct.
The sweeping and exquisitely toned camera work is the product of ace cinematographer Dariusz Wolski who so nightmarishly rendered a moody, futurescape favorite of mine, ""Dark City."" Special effects are excellent with the skeleton animation particularly outstanding. Kudos to the CG team!
This is my all time favourite film I've seen it so many times I've lost count it also happens to have my favourite actor in it Johnny Depp it's got everything action adventure great costumes and scenery it's funny exciting and Johnny Depps acting is off the charts absolutely superb. The fight sequences are awesome, also there are so many laughs. The Character development was great. I still remember all the characters even though I watched it a month ago, and I usually don't in other movies. Johnny Depp was fantastic as Captain Jack sparrow. Really unforgettable and a masterpiece. It's as good as the Disney 1990's movies. After the movie, you will definitely want to see the continuation of the story, and yes, we have the four sequels and the fifth one is coming next year. The sequels aren't as good as this. Must-watch definitely. Don't miss this movie.
The writers did an amazing job with the script, but obviously Johnny Depp did a little improv while acting this role. Very good improv at that. All the other actors where good too, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly, and Geoffory Rush, which happened to also be one of my favorite characters in the movie also. Oh yes, the role of Barbossa really knocked me in the head. His acting was almost as good as Johnny Depp's.

A damn good movie. One of the best of 2003 in my view.
This movie made me laugh, and it really pulled me in.
At first I was afraid this would be another bad Pirate movie. I went to see it anyway, as I've always loved the legends of pirates, and I love adventure. I saw it once. Then twice. Then Quadruple. Then six times. And one more 7. And now I eagerly wait for the DVD in Australia.
What I'm saying is I couldn't get enough of this movie. It was so well done.
Johnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow, and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics, and his walk really brought out this character. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy, that deserves an Oscar in my view.
Geoffrey Rush played Barbosa the bad guy. Who turned out to be quite a good bad guy in my view. He showed real potential, and I loved the way how he manipulated people.
Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, the governor's daughter. Prisoner of the Pirates. She is quite memorable in this role, and is a great jump for her ever-growing popularity.
Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner. A simple blacksmith, who is also a well trained swordsman. Who is in hot pursuit of saving Elizabeth from the Pirates.
The more memorable thing about this though is the curse. A well thought out curse. That can always lead to sequel or a prequel. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.
The story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed, and they want to rid the curse. To do that they need the blood of a pirate, not just any pirate but the son of Bill Turner- William Turner. Mistaken for Bill Turner's child the pirates Capture Elizabeth, and take her hostage, while William teams up with a Rogue pirate, Jack Sparrow, who is on a streak for revenge against Barbosa. While all at the same time are being chased by the British fleet.
A great adventure. Well played sword fighting. Great laughs. Great music. And great story. Pirates are back in my good book. I just forgot how many times I watched this film. This film has comedy, adventure, action. The climax was awesome. A must watch movie.",AZ_Doc8_pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl,Alex Zhou,Action,Positive,"Pirates of the Caribbean, the curse of the black pearl"
29,AZ_Doc9_pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl,"This is a fantastic movie full action, adventure, humor and a hell of a lot more! The film is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but that time flies by as you are transported into an awesome world of swashbuckling and sword fights.
Johnny Depp's performance is one of his best ever as the slightly camp Captain Jack Sparrow. Even under his tangle of hair and blackened eyes, he will make you swoon and laugh both at the same time with his tonnes of witty lines and mannerisms. Orlando Bloom plays the love struck son of a pirate, Will Turner and play him he does! This roll highlights the diversity and skill shown by some of the greats. We will definitely see big things from him in years to come. In her second roll in big time flick, Kira Knightley plays kidnapped Govener's daughter, Elizabeth Swan. She is also another young, up and coming star with a bright future ahead of her.
The only negative thing I have to say, and believe me I don't want to say it, is that fact we are never told the reason why the curse of the black pearl could only be broken by the blood of William Turner (Senior) and in turn by his son. Despite this plot flaw however, Pirates of the Caribbean is a magical journey that will drop the jaws of parents, children and grandparents alike. I'm definitely buying it when it come out on DVD!
The answer is yes, yes it was. Does that sound like a good economic decision? No it does not. Was it a good economic decision yes, yes it was....but who cares? Certainly not me for this film is brilliant, in every single way. Acting: Flawless. Music: Perfect. Writing/Plot/Story: Exquisite. Comedy? Hilarious. This film is by far one of the greatest films Disney has ever made. Watch it.
Beautiful costumes. Amazing story and concept and Johnny Depp is simply amazing as captain jack sparrow. Must watch. Its a combo of Action Mystery. Comedy and Adventure.
Having always been interested in pirates, curses, and adventures (when it comes to movie entertainment) this movie appealed to me the first time I saw a preview for it. I've watched this movie at least a dozen times and I still can't get over how amazingly well Johnny Depp fits the part of Captain Sparrow. His gestures, facial expressions, and his script make this movie not far from a masterpiece. Honestly it took me 2 or 3 times to completely understand the plot and all the dimensions of the curse. However, watching all the extra scenes and info on the DVD made me realize how much fun the director had making the movie (when was the last time you saw a pirate movie that cool??)

30,CJP-Doc1-No-Fear,"Hereditary is the horror film that has been described as a ride of pure terror and likened to The Exorcist and Rosemarys Baby and The Shining, to which I can say only: in its dreams. Given Im such a wuss when it comes to anything frightening  the child-catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang still scares the living daylights out of me  Im rather thankful, but Im perplexed as to why it received such rave reviews. Ride of pure terror? Ive had more terrifying rides on the teacups at the fair. I saw it at the paying cinema with my adult son and his girlfriend, who were also bored out of their minds and could only conclude that all other critics are idiots. This is as Ive long suspected, but its useful to have it confirmed.
Written and directed by Ari Aster, Hereditary stars an overwrought Toni Collette as Annie, whose mother, Ellen, has just died. Annie had a difficult relationship with Ellen and I initially thought the scene was being set for a horror spin on ambivalent motherhood, which could have been interesting, but I was wrong. Unlike, for example, Get Out, which was clever and made a point, this never felt anything other than pointless. Stuff certainly happens after Ellens death. Symbols and signs appear. A book on spiritualism is discovered. Ellens grave is desecrated. But they occur flatly, as if being ticked off some shopping list.
Ride of pure terror? I've had more terrifying rides on the teacups at the fair
The film is packed with tropes and clichs: a house in the woods, dead birds, a locked room, a creepy attic. These are knowing but there are others that, one suspects, arent knowing at all, and feed into one particular old chestnut: men are calmly sane while women are always hysterical. So Annie is the hysterical one, as is her 13-year-old daughter (Milly Shapiro), who goes all spooky and starts making clucking sounds. She also has an older son, Peter (Alex Wolff), who is not similarly afflicted  hes a typical weed-smoking teenage slacker  while their father, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), has no role to play beyond telling Annie to get a grip. Poor Steve and poor Peter, though, who dont come out of it well. But thats what happens, one must suppose, if you throw in your lot withcrazy ladies.
It isnt much of a reveal  its one minute of literal exposition right at the end  and its not much of a build-up to that reveal, as the pacing is so poor. There are decapitated heads and incinerations and rotting corpses but its never dramatic or exciting, and at the viewing I attended the audience laughed at the parts that were intended as the most terrifying, as its all so silly. Plus there are plot holes aplenty, as well as psychological ones. Annie wonders why Peter is so stand-offish with her. I dont know, but might the fact that he once woke up in the middle of the night to find shed doused him in petrol and was about to set fire to him have something do with it? Might it? One last thing, and Ill be vague here, to avoid spoiler accusations, but to those who have already seen this: why did the power have to be transferred to a male form? Why wasnt a girl good enough?

31,CJP-Doc10-Hereditary-A-Slow,"Hereditary a slow build toward horror shocks not easily forgotten

When I think of the best performances in the horror genre in this century to date, I think of Nicole Kidman in The Others, Laura Linney in The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Daniel Kaluuya in Get Out 

And now Toni Collette in Hereditary.

In fact, we can delete horror genre from the equation. Like the aforementioned performances, Collettes work in Hereditary is great acting, period.

Nearly 20 years after Collette received a best supporting actress nomination for playing a mother who is stunned when she finally realizes her little boy really does see dead people, she deserves best actress consideration for playing another mother trapped in another inexplicable, spine-tingling, seriously effed-up situation.

At one point, quite deep in the story, Collettes Annie Graham is in hysterics as she desperately tries to get her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) to believe one of their children is imminent danger, and she knows her argument makes her sound insane, and yet she keeps going and going and going, because she feels responsible for the fate of her child, and she is desperate for her husbands help, and who gives a good bleep if he thinks shes crazy if it means hell just do this one thing that could save their child.

Collette reaches for the rafters in the scene and were it not for the groundwork she has already laid down and the empathy she has created for her character, were it not for the sheer strength of the performance up to that moment  it might have been too much. It might have come across as over the top.

Instead, it pierces us to the core.

Hereditary is one of those rare and treasured horror films that does not rely on Gotcha! music stings, or rhythmic knocks on the door in the dead of night, or the cat jumping into frame during a tense moment. The shock moments here (including one that might send one or two viewers running for the exit) are truly stunning, and grotesque, and bizarre  and they will stay with you long after youve gone home for the night.

For much of the first hour, writer-director Ari Aster uses a slow build to craft this sinister story, effectively building the foundation for the madhouse well eventually occupy.

Annie is a renowned artist who specializes in meticulously crafted miniature tableaus  wondrous and sometimes disturbing doll houses, if you will  based on the people and the rooms and the events in her own life. (Hmmm, could this be a metaphor for Annies desire to control everything around her and perhaps to even play an omniscient role? Hmmmmmm.)

Hereditary begins with a funeral, the memorial service for Annies mother, a cold and distant and strange woman who never bonded with Annie but had a special connection with Annies daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro doing staggeringly fine work).

Charlie is a strange child. Very strange. She is constantly scribbling dark sketches in her notebook, shes unable to connect with others on even a basic social level, and she has morbid interests that extend to carrying around the head of a recently deceased bird.

She even prefers to sleep in the family treehouse, as if shes a figurine in one of her mothers miniaturist creations.

After a second death impacts the Graham family, Annie bonds with Joan (the amazing Ann Dowd), a warm and sympathetic mother figure she had met at a grief counseling session. Joan (in deep mourning of her own for a son and grandson killed in an accident) introduces Annie to a portal to the next world, a way for Annie to perhaps connect with the deceased.

Soon, Annie is a believer, much to the consternation of her grounded, passive husband and much to the horror of their teenage son Peter (Alex Wolff), who is dealing with all sorts of freaky baggage on his own. (Lets just say Peters worst nightmares are almost certainly way more disturbing than your worst nightmares.)

The cinematography by Pawel Pogorzelski is a beautifully frightening blend of the realistic (most of the scenes that take place outside of the home) and the surreal (just about everything that occurs within the confines of the Graham home.) The sets are exquisite, somehow giving off a creepy vibe even when it seems as if were just looking at furniture and light fixtures and a dining room table. (Something about this house just doesnt feel right.)

Even though Annies mother is almost never seen onscreen, she is a constant presence in the film. Annie is nearly obsessed with establishing shes nothing like her mother  even as she confesses certain actions that make us realize she may have inherited much of her mothers darkness. When Annie becomes convinced her mother is trying to reach out from beyond the grave to destroy her family, she barely pauses to consider how mad that sounds.

Shes a mother. She springs into action.

And where Annie goes, and what she does, and what happens to that family, is the stuff of one great horror story.",CJP-Doc10-Hereditary-A-Slow,Chris Pelkey,Horror,Positive,Hereditary
32,CJP-Doc2-Hereditary-Review,"Genuine scares give way to generic cliche in Ari Asters much garlanded debut feature

Breathless comparisons to The Exorcist, The Shining and Psycho do this fitfully frightening yet ultimately frustrating chiller few favours. Talented writer-director Ari Asters flawed feature debut has more in common with such recently challenging titles as The Witch or It Comes at Night (both also distributed in the US by indie-kings A24), although this tale of a cursed family possesses neither the sustained bone-chilling intensity of the former nor the sociopolitical dread of the latter. Veering erratically between promising setups and disappointing payoffs, it shifts from something reminiscent of the scary satire of Ira Levin toward the altogether dopier domain of Dennis Wheatley. Ironically, its the very things that Hereditary gets just right that make its clunkier missteps seem so wrong.

We start in fine form, with an Ordinary People-style opening that seems to ask: Whats wrong with this picture? Following the death of her mother, Ellen, a secretive woman with private rituals, private friends, artist Annie (Toni Collette) feels her world falling apart. Unable to mourn (Should I be sadder?) and prone to sleepwalking, she pours her troubles into her work, building small-world miniatures that resemble dolls houses designed by Diane Arbus. Its into one of these models that cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelskis camera creeps in the opening sequence, segueing seamlessly into the internecine action, suggesting that everything we see is happening in a weirdly artificial world, constructed by Annies inherited anxieties.

That sense of unease grows as Annies family scuttle around the shadows of their haunted home. Her disconnected daughter, Charlie (arresting Broadway star Milly Shapiro), cries out for her grandma, and makes strange clucking sounds while fashioning morbid totems. Husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), has the air of a condemned man as he fields calls from the cemetery about Ellens last resting place. As for teenage son, Peter (Alex Wolff), he just wants to get stoned with his buddies, clearly unable to deal with the unspoken secrets lurking in his familys past (Nobody admits anything theyve done!). And then something happens that turns grief into traumatised terror, reopening old wounds and inviting in new horrors.

To reveal specifics would risk spoiling one of the most genuinely alarming sequences Ive seen in recent years  a breathtaking jolt that made me gasp and recoil, intensified by the protracted shell-shocked silence that follows. Its a bravura cinematic coup, setting the scene for a spine-tingling meditation on grief and guilt, our senses sharpened by the promise of further scares. Those familiar with Asters short films The Strange Thing About the Johnsons and Munchausen will be primed for a poisonous dissection of twisted family rituals.

Elsewhere, a 90-degree camera-tilt mirrors a memorable moment from Babak Anvaris Under the Shadow, an astute point of reference from another tale of a besieged mother. All the more disappointing, then, that what follows gradually downshifts into generic cliche, abandoning well-mapped psychogeography for psychokinetic silliness and superfluous plot exposition.

Plaudits are due to the ensemble cast for maintaining an air of realistic distress and derangement, even as the plot parts company with credibility. Collette is terrific as the tortuously conflicted mother whose performance recalls the intensity of Essie Davis in The Babadook, a superior film to which this clearly owes a debt. Scenes between Collette and Shapiro have rich emotional resonance, while Wolff brings a sense of bewildered anger to the family table, matching Gabriel Byrnes hangdog exasperation. Meanwhile, Ann Dowd, who recently earned an Emmy for TVs The Handmaids Tale, has a tougher time as Joan, a broad-stroke character who appears to have wandered straight off the set of Rosemarys Baby.

A groaning atonal soundtrack, full of rising polyphonic crescendos and harsh cuts, provides a heartbeat of horror that pulses through a film that wears its influences on its sleeve. Yet those lured in by the quivering quotes on the posters run the risk of being underwhelmed by Hereditary, which, for all its stylistic strengths and subversive subtexts, scares only sporadically. Oh, and for the record, its William Peter Blattys The Exorcist III (rather than William Friedkins epochal original) that is most clearly evoked in a couple of creepy-crawly scenes.

33,CJP-Doc3-The-Summer_s-Big,"The Summers Big Horror Flick Hereditary Is Weird. And Not Scary.

When her 78-year-old mother dies, Annie Graham (the overexposed Toni Collette, another Australian who appears in more movies these days than Nicole Kidman) and her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) go home to a house in Utah that is bleak, dreary, unfriendly and downright creepy. Hereditary, the long, pretentious occult thriller that follows, boasts the four-word label in film-festival jargon that often reliably guarantee a torturous disaster: Big Hit at Sundance!

As alleged horror films go, this one is about as scary as the Bowery Boys in Spooks Run Wild. One week after Mom is buried, Annie finds a secret journal she left behind about spiritualism. Her grave is desecrated, so we know shes coming back. Then the kids go weird. After cutting off the head of a dead bird, socially inept 13-year-old daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) is forced to tag along with her stoned, pot-smoking older brother Peter (Alex Wolff) to a party where she swallows something lethal and on the way home he severs her own head in a fatal car accident. The already loopy Annie goes totally schizophrenic.

Oh, yes. Since you asked, there is a husband-father figure in Steve, but all he does is mope around passively, looking catatonic.

Through a member of her grief-counseling group who contacted her dead grandson with the help of a medium, Annie conducts her own sance and conjures up Charlie from beyond the grave. Things pick up mildly when gossamer spirits float through the house and Grandmas headless body is found in the attic. Peter goes berserk and bashes his head against his desk in school. Annie tries to destroy Charlies drawing book but her arm catches on fire. Lit only by candles, the freaky house turns into a cross between The Witch and Poltergeist, minus the thrills or imagination of either.

Begged by the distributor not to reveal the banal surprises that await you, I will only say that Utah plays the door to Hell and Toni Collette has never appeared more deranged and out of control. First-time director Ari Aster leads her through the gates of insanity and beyond, without a single hair-raising moment. As the incidents in the Graham household intensify, the results grow tragic, but clocking in at more than two hours, Hereditary loses so much momentum that it cant tell the difference between tragedy and tedium. It contains so few gotcha moments that box-office doom seems inescapable (I saw it in a multiplex on a Saturday night with fewer than 20 people in the audience) and there is not even a mandatory throat-tightening payoff.

It ends with Judy Collins singing Joni Mitchells ballad Both Sides Now, which makes even less sense than the movie itself.

These days actors not only appear in bad movies, they are forced to produce their own flops themselves. Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne co-executive produced Hereditary. They deserve what they get, in spades.",CJP-Doc3-The-Summer_s-Big,Chris Pelkey,Horror,Negative,Hereditary
34,CJP-Doc4-Hereditary,"To the extent that slow-burn horror movies are about atmosphere, Hereditary has many of them beaten. Using the camerawork of Pawel Pogorzelski and the music of Colin Stetson to fashion the skeleton of a superbly moody background, first-time director Ari Aster hits a home run when it comes to an overall sense of impending doom. Sadly, Asters story isnt as waterproof as his stylistic aptitude. Riddled with logical problems and plagued with a weird wtf? ending (that comes dangerously close to recalling the absurdities of mother!), the narrative skids off the track around the 3/4 mark and never recovers from the derailment. The plot contortions might all make sense during a second viewing but, with its deliberate pace, this isnt a film many people will be in a hurry to revisit.

When a movie is established as transpiring in the real world, it is incumbent on the filmmakers to adhere to basic, realistic logic in developing the narrative. For a film with supernatural elements, one expects that ghosts and other paranormal apparitions might be involved  those things are essential to the story. On the other hand, the movie shouldnt shrug off mundane things. If an accident occurs that results in severe injury or death, one expects police involvement. Whats more, this shouldnt just be swept under the rug until it becomes convenient to have a conversation about it. Problems of this nature undermine Hereditarys credibility and damage our ability to take the characters and their situations seriously.

The movie focuses on a strange and insular family, the Grahams. At the start of the proceedings, Annie Graham (Toni Collette) is preparing to bury her mother. Her husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), and teenage son, Peter (Alex Wolff), are grave, but neither seems especially upset. The only one broken up about Grandmas death is Charlie (Milly Shapiro), Peters 13-year old sister. Those hoping for a whiff of ghosts or hauntings will have to wait a while. In fact, nothing especially odd happens for about the first hour as the movie toys with our expectations, loads up on claustrophobia and eeriness, and gives us time to get to know the characters as they endure yet another tragedy. For a while, it almost seems like Hereditary is some kind of modern gothic drama, although the characters seem strangely muted and unreal. Its hard to say whether this helps or hurts when things start going bump in the night.

Toni Collettes committed performance helps to sell the movie even during its most unconvincing moments. Colette is one of a select number of currently working actresses who can play almost any role in any genre, whether its comedy, drama, or horror. Her face-off with Alex Wolff during the most uncomfortable dinner scene in any recent movie is a testimony to her ability to own the screen. Wolff and Gabriel Byrne are solid, although the script doesnt do them any favors by forcing their characters to react irrationally in both normal and extreme situations. Some (mostly inferior) horror movies thrive on characters doing stupid things; this isnt one of those. Hereditary wants to be taken seriously so when it jettisons real-world concerns to force its otherworldly agenda, it hurts the film.

Hereditary is never more than passingly frightening. The jump-scare count is low. However, although the slow-burn approach works well for a while, it ultimately goes on for too long. Momentum flags as the running length approaches (and eventually goes beyond) two hours. I cant go into specifics about why the ending doesnt work without spewing out spoilers (which I wont do) but suffice it to say the change in tone causes whiplash and the level of weirdness throttles the well-modulated, low-key style favored by Aster during the first 110 minutes. Poorly constructed endings can leave an unpleasant aftertaste even for movies that are otherwise mostly solid. Thats the case here.",CJP-Doc4-Hereditary,Chris Pelkey,Horror,Negative,Hereditary
35,CJP-Doc5-Review-Hereditary,"Theres no denying the frequent blunt-force effectiveness of writer-director Ari Asters smugly agitating feature debut, Hereditary, which begins with a showoffy shot that slowly rotates around the studio of professional diorama artist Annie Graham (Toni Collette). The camera eventually pushes into one of Annies models, which imperceptibly becomes a life-size bedroom inhabited by her husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), and their pothead son, Peter (Alex Wolff). This isnt the last time spaces, and the spaces within them, will be utilized in unnerving, disorienting fashion. (Note, for instance, the many establishing shots of the Grahams isolated woodland home that alternate between real-world and miniature exteriors.) Yet the overall effect is gloomy and humorless, as if Aster is doing a stone-faced gloss on the Wes Anderson-parodying SNL skit The Midnight Coterie of Sinister Intruders.

Aster is clearly out to mirror his protagonists volatile headspace with such disruptive visuals. Annie is reeling from the death of her mother, whom she never much liked but who still had ahint, hintbewitching effect on the family. Its been barely a week since the womans burial and everyone is still on edge. Annie throws herself into prep for a gallery show and reluctantly attends a grief support group to blow off steam. Steve gets a call from the cemetery where Annies mom is interred and hides some upsetting news from his wife: that the womans grave has been desecrated. And Peter acts the rebelliously dazed and confused adolescent, though theres something amiss in his glazed expression, as if dope isnt the only demon on his shoulder.

It certainly would be easiest to blame a Satanic influence for the fateful night when Annie forces Peter to take his sickly, mentally challenged younger sister, Charlie (Milly Shapiro)whose habit of clucking her tongue occasions a few memorable jump scaresto a high school party. Charlie has an allergic reaction after eating a piece of cake with nuts in it. Spaced-out Peter rushes her to his car, hightailing it for a hospital. And then something gruesome occurs that pushes an already troubled brood into a deranged red zone.

This section of Hereditary impressively puts any supernatural sturm und drang on the back burner and unflinchingly charts the fraying family bonds. There are a few snake-tongued confrontations between Annie and Peter that are particularly bracing as long-held resentments come to the fore, such as Annies revulsion at ever having children in the first place. Collettes jittery performance is on the fine line between ridiculous and sublime, and shes best suited to these scenes in which the horrors her character faces are of the shadowy variety, the paranormal occurrences seeming to spring from a psychologically tangible and turbulent place. Is Annie actually seeing her dead mother in a dark corner of the room, for example, or is it a mere manifestation of her fractured subconscious? Its best left imprecise.

Once it becomes apparent that the Graham family truly is a target of otherworldly malevolence, however, the film loses its menacing power and becomes a monotonous schlockfest. If the images and sounds maintain a baseline competencea dread-inducing hum underscores a number of scenes, and the climax goes inventively topsy-turvy with the laws of gravitythey never seem anything other than derivative. Asters influences are legion, from The Exorcist (an evil spirit literally and figuratively tearing a family apart) to Onibaba (specters hiding near-subliminally in the darkness). But the films patron saint is Roman Polanski, the holy text Rosemarys Baby. A shamelessly shifty Ann Dowd, overdoing the is she or isnt she evil? act as an occult-obsessed acquaintance from Annies therapy group, is essentially Ruth Gordon 2.0. And Hereditarys resoundingly silly conclusion reworks the subtle Mephistophelean poignancy of Rosemarys Babys finale into a shallow, Shyamalan-lite reveal that negates the storys fevered emotional undercurrents. The devil is certainly in these hackneyed details.",CJP-Doc5-Review-Hereditary,Chris Pelkey,Horror,Negative,Hereditary

he only false note in Hereditary  which despite the hype is far from the scariest horror film since The Exorcist but may be the most horrifying  comes right at the end.

After a climax demented enough to straddle the border between the spine-tingling and the comical, a cover of Joni Mitchells wistful Both Sides Now serenades the closing credits.
Being a 30-year-old American, writer and first-time feature director Ari Aster is excused his ignorance of UK novelty hits from almost 40 years ago. After this precociously masterful debut, he could be forgiven almost anything short of genocide.

Even so, he probably should have ended with Theres No One Quite Like Grandma by the St Winifreds School Choir. Grandma we love you, grandma we do, as mature readers will recall the opening verse in all its lyrical majesty. Though you may be far away, we think of you.

The grandma of Hereditary could hardly be further away since the film opens with her burial. But for a screen absentee she has a powerfully brooding presence that obliges us to think of her more and more.

In an unusually candid funeral eulogy, ungrieving daughter Annie Graham (Toni Collette) describes her as difficult and secretive, with a love of private rituals. Later, she frets about not feeling sadder. Had she understood the opaque note she finds in the spiritualism book among the old girls effects  Dont hate me. Our sacrifices will pale in the end next to our rewards  she would have jettisoned that guilt.

Although Asters style is determinedly languid as he layers the emotional complexities and scatters ominous narrative threads, he waits until that frantic denouement to knit together, he is swift to establish the familys peculiarity.

Annie and her stolid therapist husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) live in a large wooden house with a plethora of atmospherically underlit rooms and a spooky treehouse in the garden, all secluded in lush forestry.

Their 18-year-old son Peter (Alex Wolff) is a feckless stoner who should have paid more attention to his classics teachers ruminations on how Sophoclean characters ignore the clues about their impotence in the face of malevolent fate.

Their daughter Charlie, 13, is sensationally odd. She snips heads off dead pigeons, fills sketch pads with macabre drawings, makes the clicky tongue noise that becomes such a sinister aural motif and echoes an earlier Toni Collette child from The Sixth Sense by seeing dead people.

The casting of Milly Shapiro, fresh from wowing Broadway as Matilda, was as inspired as the make-up artists work. Charlies face, at once little girlish and as ancient as an Inca stone carving, is the creepiest element in a very crowded field. Shapiro lands an unlikely double herself, making the unsmiling, barely speaking Charlie sympathetic as well as massively offputting.

As ghoulishly isolated as the house is, its inhabitants are more so. Annie, an artist, closets herself away constructing the dolls houses in which she recreates scenes from her life in perfectionist detail, in a pitiably futile effort to impose some kind of order on a life about to veer wildly out of control.

Without giving too much away, let it suffice that badgering an unwilling late- teenage son to take his unsociable kid sister to a party is something about which the concerned parent may want to think twice. The results are horrific, emotionally and aesthetically, and launch a corkscrew spin towards hell.

Hand on heart (literally: I was checking for fear-induced, chest-thumping tachycardia), at no moment was I terrified. But terror and horror are different beasts, and Hereditary is unforgettably horrifying.

While the calamities that befall the Grahams throw up (as you may be tempted to do by the one involving ants) some gloriously gruesome shots, Aster uses them to address two of the grander questions.

One stretches back beyond even Sophocles. Is there really such a thing as free will, or are we the playthings of predetermined destiny? The other, almost as modern as DNA science, is whether environment or heredity is the dominant influence.

As Annie unwittingly begins unravelling the answers, with help from the seemingly sweet woman (Ann Dowd) she meets at a bereavement support group who encourages her to hold seances, she unravels herself.

Collettes portrayal of uncontainable psychic pain, vocally and in the anguishing close-ups that magnify her grief, is staggeringly intense. In one monologue she recounts the gothic horrors her mother inflicted on her father and brother. In others she turns viciously on her son, as if powerless to resist visiting the sins of the mother on herself, telling him she never wanted him and did all she could to miscarry.

Despite Collettes unremitting brilliance and Shapiros astonishingly assured screen debut, this is Asters film. The wide range of cinematic influences (most strikingly, Rosemarys Baby) do not compromise the originality of his perspective. As with last years Get Out, which framed an examination of racism within the horror format, he uses the conventions of the genre blood and gore, apparitions  to transcend it.

The production notes mention him enduring an unspecified but horrendous sequence of family disasters that left him feeling cursed. But there is no floundering here for cut-price catharsis; no glibly consoling message about therapy or love or art or anything being able to save us if the cosmic dice fall atrociously.

On reflection, Doris Days Que Sera, Sera (from Hitchcocks The Man Who Knew Too Much) might have been an even more searingly ironic closing track. Whatever will be will be is the unflinchingly bleak and horrifying truth that helps make Hereditary a bigger and more important film than the hype on the posters suggests.",CJP-Doc6-Hereditary-Review,Chris Pelkey,Horror,Positive,Hereditary
37,CJP-Doc7-Hereditary-Review,"The fright factor here comes less from the shrieks, decapitations and simmering undercurrent of violence than from the grief and doubt that we read in Collettes features.

Midway through writer-director Ari Asters supernatural horror film, one of the main characters pinches himself in a desperate bid to wake up. Peter (Alex Wolff) is a pot smoking teenager from a troubled family. He is in a strung out and emotional state.

Poor Peter cant work out whether he is hallucinating that he is seeing his dead and decapitated relatives  or whether he is being haunted for real. The film induces a similar feeling of queasy uncertainty in viewers.

Hereditary arrives in British cinemas already being touted after its Sundance premiere as the scariest, most bloodcurdling horror picture of the year.  The Exorcist of its era. It only partially lives up to the poster billing. Perhaps, at a midnight screening, the shock factor would have been more intense.

At a press preview on a sunny, summer morning, though, the film rarely gives you the sense that a chilly blast from Doomsday is blowing through your bones. Its real strength is less in making your hair turn white in apoplectic shock than in the ingenuity of its storytelling and its insights into why even close-knit families crumble.

Director Aster doesnt just know his horror movies. He clearly has a grounding in Greek tragedy too. At school, at least when he is paying attention, Peter is studying Sophocles. As one of his classmates notes, the protagonists in Sophocles plays are pawns in a horrible, hopeless machine.

That, of course, is exactly what Peter and his family are too. The sense that their fates are predetermined is reinforced by the films frequent references to dollhouses. Peters mother, Annie (Toni Collette), is an artist who works with miniatures, tiny sculptures of humans boxed in oppressive little rooms. She and her family are just as helpless as these miniature figurines when the evil ones come calling.

The film begins with an obituary notice, for Annies 78-year-old mother, Ellen Leigh. In pictures, she looks like a sweet old lady but Annies funeral address is strangely ambivalent. My mother was a very secretive and private woman, Annie tells a congregation full of unfamiliar faces.

Not only was Ellen secretive but she was stubborn too. (If ever she was mistaken, well, that was your opinion and you were wrong.) Sorting through her stuff, Annie comes across books on spiritualism and hints about her moms hidden life.

Only gradually does Aster reveal quite how dysfunctional this family really is. We learn that Annies schizophrenic brother committed suicide, blaming their mother for his tormented state of mind. Now, Annies own children are showing disturbing signs.

Her daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) was the grandmothers favourite and has taken the death badly. She is the type of weird child wholl cut off a dead birds head with a pair of scissors. It doesnt help that she has a nut allergy. Annie is losing her grasp on sanity. Annies even-tempered husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) is becoming increasingly concerned at her behaviour.

One of the strengths of Hereditary is the way it bottles up its supernatural elements. Early on, the film unfolds as an intense psychological drama about a family trying to process grief and guilt.

The light relief comes from Peter, a typical high school slacker type whose attention will always be more on the backside of the girl sitting in front of him than on his textbook. It takes a long time for the seances to begin and for the film to veer off into Dennis Wheatley and Rosemarys Baby-style territory.

Eventually, Aster throws in some very gruesome Grand Guignol-like scenes. We see characters garrotting themselves and being set alight. Ants come crawling out of the window sill. Arguably the most shocking moment of the film is when one character becomes possessed and starts banging his own face on a desk, smashing himself into a pulp.

For once, the site of death and maximum creepiness isnt down in the basement. Its an attic with a pull-down ladder.

Toni Collette was in The Sixth Sense and is presumably used to supernatural shenanigans. Her nuanced and very intense performance anchors the film and gives it an emotional impact it wouldnt have otherwise. She is the tragic heroine of the story, desperately trying to keep the family together.

Shell rail furiously against Peter one moment (I cant accept and I cant forgive because nobody admits what theyve done, she yells at him) and then try to smother him in love and affection the next. When she attends a self-help group for the bereaved, her revelations about her family background are startling even by comparison with what other grief-stricken families have endured.

Asters screenplay tells his story from several points of view. Perspectives shift all the time. A family member who appears sympathetic in one scene will seem very sinister the next when seen through somebody elses eyes. The film blurs the lines between what is real and what the characters are imagining.

There are moments in which the camera glides through the Grahams home. The slowness of its movement combines with the eerie, understated music from composer Colin Stetson to create a very unsettling ambience.

The creepiest performance comes from Ann Dowd as the seemingly sympathetic stranger, Joanie, who befriends Annie. Dowd is one of those character actors you recognise from other films and TV dramas without immediately being able to place her. Here, she has a toughness and meanness you can always detect in spite of her seeming kindness

Hereditary may not be as terrifying as the advance hype has suggested but its a provocative and subtle horror film with layers you dont find in more conventional haunted house tales. The fright factor here comes less from the shrieks, decapitations and simmering undercurrent of violence than from the grief and doubt that we read in Collettes features and in the eyes of her disbelieving son.",CJP-Doc7-Hereditary-Review,Chris Pelkey,Horror,Positive,Hereditary
38,CJP-Doc8-Hereditary-Review,"After the death of her difficult mother Ellen, miniature-model artist and mother of two Annie Graham (Toni Collette) feels oddly unsettled. While relieved by her parents passing, she becomes insecure about her own maternal aptitude, and starts suspecting there maybe something sinister behind her familys intensifying woes.

Hereditary is not for the faint of heart. Honestly, we really mean it. But not in the sense that it might loudly jump-scare you into cardiac arrest. Ari Asters feature debut has its thorax-tightening shock moments, but they are rare (and all the more effective for it). Primarily, it takes the crawling-dread approach to horror, often serving up its most chilling shriek-treats before you even notice theyre right there in front of you.

One scene, for example, presents a character in the gloom of a midnight-shrouded room. As they sit up in their bed, carefully positioned in the lower left of Asters frame, you know right down to your bones that something isnt right here. But youre not seeing it. Then, perhaps, someone sitting nearby you will gasp, their sudden inhalation flagging theyve spotted it before you. You look closer, your eyes darting around the frames dark edges and darker corners. You kinda dont want to. But youre compelled to. And then. Oh. Ohhh no. You see It.

Aster might be a first-time writer-director, but he is clearly a natural-born master of horror. Otherwise, we can only assume that The Wicker Man was playing on loop in his maternity ward, that he effectively grew up in Room 237 of the Overlook Hotel and visually mainlined Hideo Nakatas Ringu throughout his teen years. We wouldnt be surprised if his mothers name is Rosemary, either.

Hereditary wears its influences well, feeling inspired rather than derivative. Aster plays with a lot of recognisable ideas and tropes, but moulds them into something that hits you with minty-death freshness. There are pagan symbols and invocations. There are candle-lit sances. And as we already mentioned, there are terrible, terrible things lurking in those shadows. But he wraps it all up in a slow-burn story that plays on familiar insecurities  primarily the question of who to blame for our shortcomings: our parents? Ourselves? Or something else?

Its all presented with gorgeous Kubrickian precision and elegant trompe-loeil techniques, from a creep-zoom opening into the room of a model house (which then imperceptibly, unsettlingly transitions into the real thing), to the long, single-take glides around the Graham familys harried home, to the reflection of hell-red lights in one characters teary eyes, to the stab-quick cuts that lurch us from night to day and back again as Aster slices up time like a sushi chef.

A doomy, electronic pulse lurks low in the sound mix for most of the film, making you sit uncomfortably even when whats happening on screen appears innocent or mundane. Aster never grants his audience any relief. There are no oh its just a cat pressure releases in Hereditary. Everything is steeped in threat. Especially the places where you should feel safest.

Hes marshalled an impressive cast, too. The youngest Graham, 13-year-old Charlie, is portrayed by newcomer Milly Shapiro in a way that somehow simultaneously elicits sympathy and deep-set disquiet. Alex Wolff (Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle) sensitively portrays her older brother Peter as a teen who is, in a sense, un-coming of age  his traumas devolving him from bong-smoking slacker to squalling child, as you imagine they would anyone at his psychologically brittle stage of life.

Gabriel Byrne is suitably solid in the role of the steady, uninteresting, keeping-it-all-together (and failing) dad Steve. And as for Toni Collette in the lead role of Annie, Aster really puts her through the wringer, inflicting on his star-sufferer woes comparable with those suffered by both Essie Davis in 2014s The Babadook and Ellen Burstyn in The Exorcist. Combined. Her screen-filling, straight-to-camera looks of sheer, unfiltered terror will likely stay with you for as long as many of Hereditarys other scares. Which are numerous, relentless and never less than insomnia-invitingly intense.

A raw horror masterpiece from a first-time director that deserves to be mentioned in the same frantic breath as the genres greats. Even the most jaded viewer should find something in Hereditary to disturb and distress them. Enjoy?",CJP-Doc8-Hereditary-Review,Chris Pelkey,Horror,Positive,Hereditary
39,CJP-Doc9-Hereditary-Movie-Review,"Toni Collette is scary good in the terrifying Hereditary: EW review

Like the artsier, more audience-challenging cousin of the Blumhouse fright factory, the independent distributor A24 has been breathing new life into the once-wheezy horror genre with movies like The Witch, Under the Skin, and It Comes at Night. Now, with their latest unholy offering, Hereditary, theyve delivered their scariest movie yet.

Written and directed by first-time feature filmmaker Ari Aster, Hereditary doesnt reinvent horror cinema so much as polish the cobwebs off of its classics, strip them for parts, and refashion them into something that feels terrifyingly fresh and new. Hawk-eyed genre hounds wont have to squint very hard to spot nods to films like Rosemarys Baby, The Exorcist, and The Shining. But mostly theyll be too busy gripping their armrests to care.

The main reason that film works as well as it does is the raw, almost feral presence of Toni Collette. In what could be considered a companion piece to her performance in The Sixth Sense (not to mention the best showcase the actress has had in a while), Collette plays Annie Graham  a wife, mother of two kids, and artist who builds miniature dioramas of houses that are just odd and detailed enough to be kind of creepy.

At the beginning of the film, Annies mother has just passed away. And shortly afterward, Annies odd-duck daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) starts to act even weirder than she normally does  which is pretty weird. Theres a clucking noise that Charlie makes with her mouth that becomes increasingly disturbing. Meanwhile, Annies older son, Peter (Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungles Alex Wolff), has panic attacks when hes not trying to numb his feelings with weed. And then theres Gabriel Byrne as Steve, the stoic husband and father trying to hold everything together by ignoring the domestic nightmare unspooling around him. But its Collette who we  and the camera  keep coming back to. Shes amazing, grounding what most people might dismiss as just a scary movie with real dramatic power and force. She makes us feel in our marrow what its like to be a mother losing control of her family and maybe her mind.

Ever since Annies mother died, the Grahams have been cursed. But Aster parcels out exactly what that means at his own deliberate pace. Hereditary starts off a bit slowly (its heavy on melancholy emotions and ominous atmospherics), but once it gets going, it doesnt let up until the end credits. With a movie like this thats full of unsettling WTF twists (did I mention that The Handmaids Tales Ann Dowd pops up?), its definitely best not to know too much going in. So I wont spill the beans on all of the freaky stuff in store. But if youre the kind of horror nerd whose cage gets especially rattled by sances, shock scares, and the supernatural, youre in for a hell of a time. I cant wait to see what Aster, Collette, and A24 do next. A-",CJP-Doc9-Hereditary-Movie-Review,Chris Pelkey,Horror,Positive,Hereditary
40,CMP_Doc10_Poltergeist,"This film is not without merits - but it certainly is no classic. It's aged badly, the characterisation is poor, and there are at least a dozen things about it that really grate, e.g.; the fact that the whole film is an excuse to use special effects; the fact that everyone blindly accepts the existence of ghosts and attributes any strange happenings to them without considering any other explanation; the cheesy horror clichs; the annoyingly sickly suburban family; the odd moral of the tale (treat those corpses with respect or else!); the American-dream-gone-wrong theme which doesn't quite work (given the fact that this is a 10 on the daft scale); and, last but not least, the fact that one of the paranormal investigators is scared half to death by the crawling meat scene; and yet ten minutes ago, he was happily documenting dozens of levitating objects flying around a bedroom.

That said, the special effects are quite good for the time, and the acting does it's best with such a daft story. At this point, you may be thinking; ""this guy just doesn't like the genre"". Not true; but in my opinion, effective, truly scary horror is created by the maxim ""less is more"" - not the more is more approach that Spielberg has employed successfully in other films, and less well here. A disappointment; go watch Ring instead for truly creepy television antics.

One last thing; it's appalling this got a PG in the US. One particularly disgusting scene involving peeling flesh is clearly unsuitable for kids, and I can imagine this giving young children nightmares, as hokey as it is. I suggest your kids should be at least twelve before you watch this with them.

The movie starts out promising, with the discovery of *something* in the house. A few early scenes are startling, and I was hoping for greatness.

Unfortunately, it quickly falls apart. Honestly, it feels like several different movies were shot, and the scenes pieced together to make Poltergeist. It's so...random....both in terms of plot elements and the characters' reactions to them. First it's just spooky presences, then a tree comes to life (what?). Then there's a vortex in the closet leading to where some creature lives. Then someone tears apart his own face for no real reason (an exercise in special effects?), but was it imagined or real? Then there are zombies. There's no driving logic. It's simply ""anything goes.""

The ending especially feels tacked on. There's closure, in that the house has been freed of spirits. Then all of a sudden it's possessed again by something with no relation to the rest of the movie.

All of this film is just poorly done. I like Steven Spielberg's work and I am a huge fan of horror movies but Poltergeist lacks a lot of interesting things to be considered a classic, or a good horror movie. I feel like it is overrated mainly because it falls under the ""it's from the 80s so it must be rather good"" conventionalization. Firstly, the plot is nonsense even though it could have been great. So an entire neighborhood was built over a huge cemetery, which is why these random ghosts decide to kidnap, for whatever reason, a young girl during a stormy night. Her parents seek help and so a group of ghost-busters goes into the house and, by doing pretty much nothing, save the girl. After that there is a huge ghost manifestation that forces the family to finally leave the house, and that's it. Almost two hours for not too much going on.

The effects are good for the time, the acting is solid, camera work is flawless, but there just had to be more to this film! Its tone felt WAY too comic, the horrible music appears to be composed for a drama flick, and there aren't just enough ""scary"" moments. I am not talking about jump-scares (no one cares about them), but about creepy atmospheres and unsettling events! This movie lacked that precisely, and it's the whole point of horror movies! I understand that 70s-80s was the era of slashers and maybe Poltergeist tried to do something different for the time being, but it just didn't get it right.

All in all, this film isn't a classic nor the best horror movie ever made nor anything memorable. If you wish to watch it just for the sake of it being popular and famed, go ahead, but have in mind that this isn't 1980 and therefore it won't be even slightly impressive.",CMP_Doc10_Poltergeist,Chad Parvis,Horror,Negative,Poltergeist
41,CMP_Doc1_Poltergeist,"Special effects in the movies have grown so skilled, sensational, and scary that they sometimes upstage the human actors. And they often cost a lot more. In ""Poltergeist,"" for example, the cast is made up of relatively unknown performers, but that's all right because the real stars are producer Steven Spielberg (""Raiders of the Lost Ark""), director Tobe Hooper (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""), and their reputations for special effects and realistic violence. Their names on this horror film suggest that its technology will be impeccable. And they don't disappoint us. This is the movie ""The Amityville Horror"" dreamed of being. It begins with the same ingredients (a happy American family, living in a big, comfortable house). It provides similar warnings of doom (household objects move by themselves, the weather seems different around the house than anywhere else). And it ends with a similar apocalypse (spirits take total possession of the house, and terrorize the family). Even some of the special effects are quite similar, as when greasy goo begins to ooze around the edges of a doorjamb.

But ""Poltergeist"" is an effective thriller, not so much because of the special effects, as because Hooper and Spielberg have tried to see the movie's strange events through the eyes of the family members, instead of just standing back and letting the special effects overwhelm the cast along with the audience. The movie takes place in Spielberg's favorite terrain, the American suburb (also the locale of parts of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""Jaws"" and ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial""). The haunted house doesn't have seven gables, but it does have a two-car garage. It is occupied by a fairly normal family (two parents, three kids) and the movie begins on a somewhat hopeful note with the playing of ""The Star Spangled Banner"" as a TV station signs off.

The opening visuals, however, are somewhat ominous. They're an extreme close-up of a TV screen, filled with the usual patriotic images (Iwo Jima, the Lincoln Memorial). Why so close? We're almost being invited to look between the dots on the screen and see something else. And indeed, the family's youngest daughter, an open-faced, long-haired, innocent little cherub, begins to talk to the screen. She's in touch with the ""TV people."" Before long she disappears from this plane of existence and goes to live with the TV people, wherever they are. Weird events begin to happen in the house. An old tree behaves ominously. The swimming pool seems to have a mind of its own. And the villains are the same people who were the bad guys in Spielberg's ""Jaws"" -- the real estate developers. This time, instead of encouraging people to go back into the water, they're building a subdivision on top of an old graveyard.

This is all ridiculous, but Hooper and Spielberg hold our interest by observing the everyday rituals of this family so closely that, since the family seems real, the weird events take on a certain credibility by association. That's during the first hour of the movie. Then all hell breaks loose, and the movie begins to operate on the same plane as ""Alien"" or ""Altered States,"" as a shocking special-effects sound-and-light show. A closet seems to exist in another dimension. The swimming pool is filled with grasping, despairing forms of the undead. The search for the missing little girl involves a professional psionics expert, and a lady dwarf who specializes in ""cleaning"" haunted homes. Nobody ever does decide whether a poltergeist really is involved in the events in the house, or who the poltergeist may be, but if that doesn't prevent them from naming the movie ""Poltergeist"" I guess it shouldn't keep us from enjoying it.",CMP_Doc1_Poltergeist,Chad Parvis,Horror,Positive,Poltergeist
42,CMP_Doc2_Poltergeist,"The kids know first. Carol Anne likes to wander down to listen to the voices that come from the TV after all the programs have ended, and her brother Robbie has begun to have nightmares about the tree outside his window.

The parents, being adults, are a bit slower to sniff the change in their house, at least until Diane has that trouble with the kitchen chairs. Once the chairs begin to rearrange themselves, right there in broad daylight, while the construction gang out back is still goofing off around the swimming-pool site and the neighbors are going about their business as if there is nothing new under the sun in the suburbs, only then does the Freeling family get the gist of things. The idea is, they are not the only people living in their own house. Something, some things, are in there with them. What things could these be? And what are their intentions?

Ooh-eeh-ooh. It's Poltergeist, the story of a very haunted house. It's a great big scary movie for the summer, and it's a good one. Poltergeist (the ""noisy ghosts,"" the Germans called them when they coined the word centuries ago) seems designed to show us that the horror movie is still Hollywood's prime genre. As a piece of entertainment, it is nearly everything that most of the potboilers since The Exorcist have not been, and as a piece of art it is a grand thumbing of the nose at filmmakers whose creative vision isn't quite so keen as that of Steven Spielberg and his collaborators. And though the movie has its fancy moments, what sets it apart is simple storytelling. It's a solid movie in every way, and it's best when it is simplest.

We can't be sure whom to credit. Poltergeist was directed by Tobe Hooper, who was allowed to graduate from Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Eaten Alive to this, the bigtime, but producer and cowriter Steven Spielberg has been receiving most of the praise so far. Reportedly, Hooper and Spielberg did not get along well; reportedly, Spielberg stepped in to ""supervise"" the production of Poltergeist. Certainly, it has his mark on it, a deadeye fix on what pleases audiences and keeps them in thrall. It's an all- American movie , and the temptation is to lay it all on Spielberg, the Jack Armstrong of filmmakers.

As has always been true, what makes such films work is the care taken to set things up. We'll want to see those special effects sooner or later, and a few shock scenes are de rigeur. But first, the family and its milieu; once we have accepted the Freeling family as real people in a real place, then we will be scared of almost anything that happens to them. And here is where Poltergeist works the real movie magic.

Spielberg and Hooper create an ordinary family in an ordinary suburb with impeccable detail, without a trace of condescension. Everything here is familiar, all the totems invoked: It's a family with a mom and a dad, two girls and a boy, a dog and a canary, a couple of TV sets. It's a middle- tech family with all the labor-saving conveniences, and a Sunday afternoon in their neighborhood, established by 10 minutes of gently funny vignettes, is an almost universal time and place. At the Freeling house, the neighborhood men are watching the Rams game. Out in the street, the neighborhood kids are curbsitting, waiting for a chance to pull a prank with a pair of remote-controlled model cars. Lawns are green, sun is warm, houses are neat as pins and expensive-looking, if maybe a bit too close together.

That's the problem with these planned communities, and the biggest disturbance of this or any other Sunday afternoon is that Freeling's television set, the one on which the men are depending for the Rams resolution, is of the same brand and remote-control frequency as that of the guy next door, who doesn't much care about the Rams and whose kid wants to watch ""Mister Rogers."" So for this day, the Freelings' biggest problem is the remote-control war, by which a long curl pattern, Rams driving, is replaced without warning by a smiling face and kiddie patter. It's funny, and it's familiar. Wherever it is that the Freelings live, we think we've been there.

The next day, there is the trouble with the chairs, and in the days after that all hell breaks loose, literally, in the very same house. The details are secrets that belong to the movie , but its success owes to the careful establishment of ordinary circumstance, and to the performances of the no-name cast playing the various Freelings. Craig T. Nelson is Dad, a real-estate salesman and a nice guy; Oliver Robins is Robbie, the boy whose tree seems to have turned scary; Dominique Dunne is the teenager, Dana; Heather O'Rourke is the angel-faced little girl, Carol Anne, who hears the ""TV people""; and Jobeth Williams is mom, whose house is suddenly an amusement park. They're all-Americans, and they're all good.

Poltergiest is no nonstop scream express; at times it pulls its punches (Spielberg wants that PG rating), and at times its effects are bigger than life and less than terrifying. But like Spielberg's Jaws, which was a perfect genre movie , Poltergeist does what it's supposed to do about as well as it can be done. You want to see a movie about the house next door that turns out to be haunted? Here it is, done just right.",CMP_Doc2_Poltergeist,Chad Parvis,Horror,Positive,Poltergeist
43,CMP_Doc3_Poltergeist,"Horror fans  hardcore horror fans  don't rate Poltergeist. It lacks the gore of Argento,the intensity of Romero and the guts of Cronenberg to galvanize the Fangoria crowd. Yet the bloodlust of fanboys misses the point by a mile. A kind of scarefest starter pack for younger audiences  My First Horror Film  Poltergeist represents the finest example of cinema as fairground ghost train, a brilliantly orchestrated collection of jumps and jolts, childhood phobias that will scare you witless for its 114 minute duration but not trouble anyone over six once the house lights have come up.

Akin to many fairy tales, Poltergeist concerns itself with a child trying to find her way back to the comforts of home (see The Wizard Of Oz (1939) yet plays out its yarn from the point of view of the adults. However, there is a more cynical encapsulation than the modern day fable; as spectres emanate from the TV set to kidnap blonde moppet Carol Anne (a captivating Heather O'Rourke, who Spielberg cast after spotting her dining in the MGM commissary), perhaps Poltergeist is best described as a black comedy about the dangers of kids catching too much tube. Even the afterlife looks like the blue flicker of late night TV.

Most of the attention surrounding the film on release was directed towards the question of authorship: while Tobe Hooper, the hand behind The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) was nominally credited as director, Poltergeist (the word is German for ""noisy ghosts"") had co-writer/executive producer Steven Spielberg's imprint indelibly stamped all over it: suburban milieu (check), rollercoaster plotting (check), deftly placed comic relief (check), a kidnapped child as a catalyst for the plot (check), light as a major player in the story, a source of both mystery and sanctity (check).

Spielberg created the storyboards, hired the cast, approved camera movements, and supervised the editing and visual effects. In fact, the only sequence that displays any hint of Hooper's sensibilities is the climax, in which a posse of rotting cadavers erupt from a muddy swimming pool  apparently, this is Spielberg's least favourite scene in the whole film. (After Poltergeist was released Spielberg, took out a full page ad in the trade papers, thanking Hooper for what he described as a ""unique, creative relationship"").

If Spielberg's storyline owed much to Twilight Zone episode Little Girl Lost (as well as being a twisted version of Close Encounters), the detail was ripped straight from the fabric of his life; the crack in the bedroom wall, the maniacal grinning doll, the ominous oak tree all have one foot in Spielberg's past. Unlike many haunted house flicks, Poltergeist locates its horrors in a warm, inviting environ, a haven of radio controlled cars, Star Wars bedspreads, Sunday football and twee burial services for dead pets. The set-up is archetypal rather than stereotypical, tapping into collective childhood memories that brim with cognition.

The Freeling family (the moniker more than likely a reference to legendary animator Fritz Freleng) may be mere spectators to all the paranormal palaver, yet there are enough shades to make you care. Early on, the spectral activity is treated with the sense of playfulness  the room full of swirling playthings  and awe that Spielberg usually reserves for extra-terrestrials. After the relatively benign beginning, however, the chill factor is ratcheted up as a panoply of shock tactics are unleashed at a breakneck pace  the ominous tree turns kidnapper; psychic investigator, played by Spielberg's assistant Marty Cassella, pulls the flesh from his own face (Spielberg, incidentally, supplied the hands); a demonic head erupts from the closet; Diane is thrown all over the walls and ceilings (a risque notion of the ghost sexually assaulting Diane  ILM even created a rig that pulled Jobeth Williams' clothes offwas discarded). Oh yes, and then, the house implodes.

There are inconsistencies  why does a brand new house have the standard creaking door?  but the pace is so compelling that it is impossible to carp. Yet, for all the grand guignol on offer, the film is much more unnerving in its smaller moments: kitchen chairs rearrange themselves into illogical formations, a slab of steak inches its way across a kitchen surface and, it has to be said, Carol Anne's infamous ""They're here"" far outstrips ""I see dead people"" as dialogue to freeze the blood.

In the summer of 1982, Poltergeist was virtually buried alive by Spielberg's other suburban set fantasy, E.T. The Extra Terrestrial.",CMP_Doc3_Poltergeist,Chad Parvis,Horror,Positive,Poltergeist
44,CMP_Doc4_Poltergeist,"MORE than any other Hollywood film maker of his generation, Steven Spielberg has preserved the wonderment of childhood while growing up to make the sort of movies he always loved as a child, but bigger and better and far more imaginative. He's a brilliant technican who still has doubts about the dark.

His ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' was the last, dazzling word on sci-fi fantasies, not about the end of the world but about the beginning of a benign new one. ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' is every cliffhanging adventure film ever made, wrapped up into one hilarious odyssey, but with few of the anticlimaxes usual in such films.

Now, in ''Poltergeist,'' co-produced by Mr. Spielberg, directed by Tobe Hooper and based on Mr. Spielberg's original story, he has come up with a marvelously spooky ghost story that may possibly scare the wits out of very small children and offend those parents who believe that kids should be protected from their own, sometimes savage imaginations.

I suspect, however, that there's a vast audience of teen-agers and others who'll love this film. Indeed, ''Poltergeist'' often sounds as if it had been dictated by an exuberant 12-year-old, someone who's sitting by a summer campfire and determined to spin a tale that will keep everyone else on the edges of their knapsacks far into the night.

''Poltergeist,'' which opens today at the Cinerama and other theaters, is full of creepy, crawly, slimy things that jump out from the shadows. It contains playful ghosts and mean ones. It's a film in which childhood wishes and fears are made manifest, as in the image of a gnarled, long-dead tree, something to climb during the day and play in, but which, at night, casts scary shadows on a child's bedroom wall.

''Poltergeist'' is like a thoroughly enjoyable nightmare, one that you know that you can always wake up from, and one in which, at the end, no one has permanently been damaged. It's also witty in a fashion that Alfred Hitchcock might have appreciated. Offhand, I can't think of many other directors who could raise goose bumps by playing ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' behind a film's opening credits.

The setting is an ordinary, quintessentially middle-class, new California subdivision called Cuesta Verde, where every house looks alike and comes equipped with the same vast assortment of appliances. Every family in Cuesta Verde is more or less on the same social, economic and book-club level.

However, it's to the credit of Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Hooper, and to the screenplay by Mr. Spielberg, Michael Grais and Mark Victor, that though the members of the Freeling family are typical, they aren't the nonentities one usually finds in such movies. This is as much a reflection of the manner of the movie as it is of the characters.

Steve and Diane Freeling (Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams) are in their 30's, happily married, doing all right financially and the parents of three children, a daughter in her midteens (Dominique Dunne), a son several years younger (Oliver Robins) and a 10-year-old daughter, Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke). Carol Anne, a small, blond beauty, becomes the innocent hostage of the occult forces that, one night, come flying out of the untended television set.

It's one of the nicer variations on the film's ghost theme that the Freelings, though baffled by this visitation, are not initially panicked. Diane Freeling is enchanted when she finds that she can play games with the unseen creatures, rather as if they were to be treated as rare pets.

Suddenly, however, for reasons that are finally explained, they turn mean. All hell breaks loose, requiring the services first of an intelligent, somewhat embarrassed psychologist (Beatrice Straight), who moonlights as a parapsychologist, and eventually those of a most eccentric exorcist, a tiny woman played by Zelda Rubinstein, whose last film assignment was in ''Under the Rainbow.''

Further details of the plot should not be revealed. More important are the film's extraordinary technical effects, by which we are made to see and experience the terrible assaults these angry spirits make on the Freelings, sometimes occupying their minds as well as their house. These effects are often eerie and beautiful but also occasionally vividly gruesome.

The structure of the film is not perfect. It seems to have two endings. This isn't because there are two, but because the film's exorcism rite is so spectacular that one really isn't prepared for still another confrontation, which doesn't quite measure up to the first one.

Miss Williams, still better known as a New York stage actress than as a film actress, is charming as the beleaguered Mom, a modern sort of woman who isn't above smoking a little marijuana after the kids are safely tucked into bed. Mr. Nelson is also good as the stalwart but not stolid father, and the children are excellent, especially Miss O'Rourke. The style of the film is probably best exemplified by the performances of Miss Straight and Miss Rubinstein, who play it absolutely without facetiousness, though with great good humor, and never look silly.

There's some controversy about the individual contributions to the film made by Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Hooper, best known as director of ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.'' I've no way of telling who did what, though ''Poltergeist'' seems much closer in spirit and sensibility to Mr. Spielberg's best films than to Mr. Hooper's.

''Poltergeist,'' which has been rated PG (''Parental Guidance Suggested''), is a movie that parents will want to consider very carefully before sending off very young children to see it. Though it's as harmless as a nightmare, it could also prompt some.

",CMP_Doc4_Poltergeist,Chad Parvis,Horror,Positive,Poltergeist
45,CMP_Doc5_Poltergeist,"In this boom time for space fantasies and ghost stories, Steven Spielberg has scooped his colleagues by coming into town with an example of each. He has thus won himself two full-dress salutes in the Sunday New York Times and has preempted movie houses all over the city. Poltergeist and E.T., Spielberg tells us, spring, respectively, from the dark and sunny chambers of his childhood imaginings. They spring also from innumerable fictions, print and film, of the remote and recent past. Spielbergs is not a conspicuously inventive mind; it is, however, creatively acquisitive, and I believe that his popular appeal rests considerably on his effective reworking of familiar material. Like riders on a roller coaster, the viewers know what to expect, they whoop and clutch one another in happy expectation.

Poltergeist warns us that if we trifle with the last resting places of the dear departed, they will express their resentment in a variety of horrid ways. This suggestion, reasonable enough if you hold with the posthumous persistence of identity, is as old as Edgar Allan Poe. In this case the ghosts emerge through the screen of the Freeling familys TV set, which is tuned to an unoccupied channel, the station having signed off for the night. (This is one of those households where the set is never turned off.) Once out of limbo, and their complaints still unattended, the wraiths progress from table-stirring and chair-stacking to creating gales, abducting a small girl, manifesting themselves in guises that recall the Jabberwock and other goggle-eyed, slavering anomalies. Their discontent reaches a climax during a torrential storm, when the earth heaves and the graves give up their dead. The noise, on screen and in the audience, was deafening.

What pleased me in Poltergeist was the vain attempt of Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight), a thoroughly scientific investigator of paraphysical phenomena, to cope with the rampaging spirits. They scare the wits out of her, and she has eventual recourse to a diminutive medium with a high and commanding voice (Zelda Rubinstein), who is not at all cowed by the boisterous aggressions of the restless dead. When it comes to exorcism, incantation outscores electronic scanning.

What bored me about the picture was the beleaguered Freeling family. Like other merchants of spookery, Spielberg likes to display his improbabilities in the most banal of settings, but he tends (as in Close Encounters of the Third Kind) to carry this sound policy too far. The Freelings are folk you meet every time you turn on the television; they will be shouting with delight over their breakfast cereal, boasting of the whiteness of their wash and the sterility of their bathrooms, and rushing to embrace Dad when he drives up in the new station wagon. Spielbergs intent may be satirical, but I find these stereotypes even more depressing than hobgoblins, and would not have minded if theyd all been dragged off into the fourth dimension to simply rot away for the rest of eternity.

46,CMP_Doc6_Poltergeist,"A peaceful suburban home suddenly becomes a gateway for enraged ghosts who kidnap a little girl and take her to their twilight world. Hiring paranormal experts, the girl's family attempts to discover why she was taken and how to get her back.

A vapid, silly horror movie with occasional moments of promise that ultimately fails due to an overdose of cuteness. Steve and Diane (Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams) are a happy suburban couple who suddenly find that their perfect house in the perfect neighborhood has begun acting funny, scaring their perfect children. They really sit up and take notice, however, when wide-eyed young daughter Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) becomes possessed by late-night television and gets sucked into limbo by God knows what. Enter clairvoyant Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein), who surmises that the subdivision was built on a sacred Indian burial ground and that the gods aren't happy. POLTERGEIST is frustrating because one gets a hint of what director Tobe Hooper really wanted to do, but it's obvious that he was restrained by producer Steven Spielberg. The problem is, some of the truly horrifying moments slip through the censorship cracks, scaring little kids (and their parents), leaving POLTERGEIST a very disjointed, uneven movie.

If your TV set swallowed your daughter and your house became possessed, what would you do? Silly question, sure, but then that's the problem facing parents JoBeth Williams and Craig T Nelson, as their slice of suburbia becomes the setting for a muddled Spielberg epic.

""Poltergeist"" contains many good elements but the assembly of them is haphazard and the overlong running time allows the film to dawdle when it should be racing. The actors are excellent, the special effects are good, and the premise suitably weird. But the combination of director Tobe Hooper and producer Steven Spielberg lends the film a schizophrenic nature that sometimes translates into cold nastiness.

This disjointed feel is evident from the beginning where the camera follows two speeding toy cars causing mayhem in a quiet street. We arrive at the house of the damned only to find an argument raging over the use of the remote control. This is classic Spielberg as he paints his take on suburban life.

The film then cuts to a shot of the hideously deformed tree outside the house. This chilling imagery is Tobe Hooper territory. His eye so effectively turned objects into instruments of fear in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and he uses the same skill well in ""Poltergeist"".

This wrestling of ideas is so obvious throughout the movie as Spielberg injects comedy where Hooper is laying down fear. Added to that, an enthusiastic special effects team breaks up any tension with overlong displays of their talents.

Despite all this, there are many fine moments of dark humour and some memorable shots. But this is a film that tends to annoy, as if it had been more taut and consistent, it could have been far more exciting. It is one of Speilberg's worst movies.

47,CMP_Doc7_Poltergeist,"I like horror films. No, I love them. But this...this was not horror in the common sense. It was horrible.

The plot could have been good if it weren't for the acting, the music, the special effects (ridiculous), the set....the everything else.

I wanted to like this film, I really wanted to, but I had no chance. I watched it with my boyfriend an we both agreed that this was a really bad film.

I cannot even write down everything I hated about this film because I have a word maximum, but how about a sneak-piece of how bad this film actually was?

There is a Poltergeist (which is no spoiler since that is the title) and they drew it. Like, with pencils. It looks like a Disneyfilm! A bad one! Yes, fine, the film is old, but come on, that is the best they could do? I doubt it!

SPOILER

Then, at one point in the film, the mother and the daughter return from what I understood as some kind of afterlife and, without any reason, they were covered in a pink glibber. It made no sense and it was disgusting. I am just writing this down because it kind of summarizes the film. Weird and inexplicable.

Do NOT watch this, I advise, do NOT! Eat a sandwich instead, that will be more thrilling.

This film was terrible, the 'special' effects where so terribly bad they where annoying!(even for the time.) This film reminded me of a low budget Disney film. It had a very unclear storyline that seemed to o nowhere. It got really silly not far into the film. From a plastic tree attacking a boy and then objects floating around the room It got so bad.

One of the worst films I have ever seen. On the back of the DVD box it claims strong horror and is rated a 15. I was very left down when every scene failed to even make me jump, once! It seriously wasn't scary at all.

Blurb: ""They're here,"" 'playful at first... but not for long. A storm erupts, a tree attacks and little carol Anne freeling is whisked in to a spectral void. As her family confronts horrors galore, something else it here too: a new benchmark in Hollywood ghost stories.' The film claims to be a classic, don't bother with this film.

Horror movies are my favorite, but I'm not the type of horror movie fan that will simply judge a movie on its horribly photoshopped cover or generally hold holier than thou attitudes toward technique, execution, writing, and cinematography (although I will bask in the glory of these done well), especially when it comes to remakes. I like to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Poltergeist was no different. I had wanted to see it for quite awhile but wasn't convinced that it was a movie I needed to buy for $14.99 (thanks iTunes for your options, btw). After watching it tonight (for free, streaming online) the only two things that keep resounding in my head are ""Thank you inner voice for telling me not to hit the purchase button"" and ""OMG. Worst. Ever."" In fact, I will go as far as to say that it's probably one of the worst horror attempts I've ever seen.

48,CMP_Doc8_Poltergeist,"When it comes to the likes of horror flicks, Poltergeist has got to be one of the all-time, most over-rated pieces of movie-junk that I have ever seen. There's no ifs, ands, or buts, about it.

From start to finish, Poltergeist is nothing but an over-blown, thoroughly obnoxious mess of a horror movie. Its story escalates (at break-neck speed) into one of the stupidest 'hauntings' imaginable.

There's absolutely no subtlety, or artistic restraint in evidence anywhere in this flick. We, the viewer, are literally bulldozed to death, and then buried alive by an onslaught of preposterous special effects that are only there to distract us from the plain, simple truth that - ""THIS FLICK REALLY SUCKS!!""

Just like The Shining - I cannot figure out, for the frickin' life of me, why so many people continue (32 years later) to still make such a ridiculous fuss over this one. Let's face it - Poltergeist isn't that good. It isn't!

For one thing - Not only are all of the kids in Poltergeist totally revolting and worthy of being slaughtered within the first half hour of this flick, but the adults are definitely in need of a good decapitation, too. It's true. One can't help but loathe every last one of them.

And on top of all of that - Would someone please tell me - What sort of a Property Development Company builds a subdivision of homes right on top of a goddamn graveyard, and only moves the frickin' headstones to another location, and leaves the actual coffins still buried there in the ground? Eh? Who??

Like, am I expected to accept, without question, that during the initial excavation of all of this property (laying sewer pipes, creating basements, building swimming pools, etc., etc.) that not a single, solitary coffin was ever dug up at this point? And - Am I also supposed to believe the the entire construction crew working on this project were actually all in on this conspiracy not to move any of the graves, and so they just built everything around them?

C'mon, now! That's just plain preposterous and idiotic.

When you seriously consider the illogical aspect of it all - Poltergeist simply comes out as being just a really dumb horror movie. Its story is an absolute insult to the intelligence of even the most average-thinking person.

So, there!

As some sort of compensation for my attitude towards this flick - It gives me the greatest of pleasure to know that behind the scenes of this flick's production, Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper were at each other's throats constantly over the direction of Poltergeist. Things got so nasty between these 2 that Hooper was eventually removed from his directorial duties, and Spielberg, himself, took over the show.

This haunted house movie has the look and feel of the low-budget horror movies of the 1950s except that it's not as good. Although directed by Hooper, this has all the earmarks of a Spielberg film. Spielberg co-produced and wrote the story, and it's the funniest material he has ever written. Unfortunately, all the laughs are unintentional. It's meant to be scary, but it's utterly ridiculous, with no rhyme or reason to the proceedings. The sets are cheap looking and the special effects are cheesy. The acting is uniformly bad, not helped by the pedestrian dialog. On a poignant note, it's hard to watch this without thinking about the tragic short lives of O'Rourke and Dunne, who play sisters.",CMP_Doc8_Poltergeist,Chad Parvis,Horror,Negative,Poltergeist
49,CMP_Doc9_Poltergeist,"On a sleepy weekend morning in the subdivision of Cuesta Verde, little Carol Anne Freeling (Heather ORourke) walks downstairs and begins talking to the static on the television set. Later that day, a crowd of fathers gather around a different TV to watch the big football game  interrupted by a neighbor with a matching remote control just a bit too close to the house. As a storm moves into the area and night settles in once again, other routines take place in the Freeling house: a pet bird passes away and requires a burial; older sister Dana (Dominique Dunne) rolls her eyes at the event and concerns herself with her friends; middle brother Robbie (Oliver Robins) climbs the oversized, gnarled tree outside his bedroom window; mother Diane (JoBeth Williams) consoles them all before bed; and father Steve (Craig T. Nelson) reads a book and goofs around in front of a mirror as his wife smokes a joint.

The sound of the national anthem blaring on a television set nicely contrasts  or perhaps distracts from  the horrors that await. Strange things start to happen in the Freeling home, and it doesnt help that theres a large clown doll staring at the children in their room, and that the massive tree next to the house seems to be watching, menacingly at the slumbering youths. Impressively, theres a complete naturalness to the characters interactions and small talk, right down to their idiosyncratic habits, the way they console one another, and even the way they move about the house. This greatly helps to make these eventual victims sympathetic and relatable and to define them as realistic, average people.

Theyre here! So when furniture rearranges itself; Diane figures out how to get the TV people to move objects based on specific spots in the kitchen; music plays and lights flicker on their own; and other mild phenomena plague the household, its curious at first, instead of petrifying. The adults possess mild disbelief, but quickly search for answers based on the existence of ghosts. Through amusing editing techniques, including gaps in time and jarring shifts to the next scene, the film progresses quickly and escalates into genuine horror without much warning. Though theres something entirely dismaying about kids behaving unexpectedly and the family dog barking inexplicably at nothing, those events arent enough to forewarn of just how unnervingly chaotic subsequent incidents will become.

Upbeat, sensationally adventurous music (by Jerry Goldsmith) during the opening title credits instantly denotes that filmmaker Steven Spielberg had a hand in this movies creation (here he served as writer and producer), which gives further insight into the playfulness of the initial activities and the focus on scary things occurring to kids (coupled with bits of movie memorabilia, such as an Alien poster on the childrens wall, a black-and-white Spencer Tracy picture on the tube, and Star Wars items in the room). But with Tobe Hoopers direction, theres also a decidedly sinister side to the happenings  quite suddenly, in fact, when a mutant tree creature attempts to consume Robbie, and when a tornado appears out of nowhere to yank that tree into the sky. Presumably from his involvement, the extraneous children are removed from the picture in favor of adults who can more appropriately cope with the situation. Its very much the truly frightening version of Ghostbusters  especially when parapsychologists (and then an exorcist) are called in to conduct a proper investigation, and they exhibit fascination almost as much as fear.

Despite the gamesome attitude toward such obvious paranormal mischievousness, there are also moments of extreme gruesomeness  signature components of a project involving Spielberg. These sequences of body horror dont hold up as well as in a project like Raiders of the Lost Ark, but theyre effective in generating striking, nightmarish imagery. Additionally, the inclusion of diminutive actress Zelda Rubinstein is a stroke of genius; shes incredibly odd but plays it straight, becoming the perfect choice for a source of grave, morbid exposition. Alone, she amplifies the project to a level far beyond what more special effects or boo moments could have accomplished. And with its spectacularly rambunctious finale, Poltergeist cements its place as one of the all-time great haunted-house epics.",CMP_Doc9_Poltergeist,Chad Parvis,Horror,Positive,Poltergeist

Brief Summary: A soldier fighting aliens gets to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies.

Whenever I walk into a theater, I ask myself two questions: What is this movie about? and Does it involve Adam Sandler? After Im satisfied that the answer to the second question is no, I can concentrate on the story (followed by the acting and the directing and all that other stuff).

On rare occasions, I may have to see a movie a second time to appreciate the clues that, say, Bruce Willis is actually a dead guy. But I suspect that if I had nine lifetimes, I still wouldnt understand the sci-fi flick Edge of Tomorrow. And it isnt some mystical mind-blower like 2001: A Space Odyssey; its just basically a battlebots movie with a malfunctioning game clock.

Without clues like flying cars and melting ice caps, I can only guess that this story is set in the very near future, when tentacled aliens will descend on Europes most photogenic cities. The best hope for Battlefield Earth is Cage (Tom Cruise). Technically a major in an international defense force, Cage is a specialist in public relations (i.e., propaganda). He arrives at HQ in London expecting to write a story about an imminent counteroffensive, and he declines a chance to fight on the front lines because hes a bit of a coward. Thats a novel premise for a Cruise movie; but soon hes reluctantly tossed into battle like the rookie from The Red Badge of Courage.

And then the strangest thing happens.

As soon as the feckless foot soldier gets turned into hamburger, he gets jolted back to the barracks, where he hears the same rah-rah speech about glorious sacrifice, dons the same armored skeleton and takes the same kamikaze plunge into battle.

And then again. And again.

Sexy supersolider Rita (Emily Blunt) realizes that Cage is infected with alien blood that allows him to skip backward a few hours and amend his mistakes  because she had the same power. Now that shes lost it, she must train Cage to be the ultimate warrior, even if it means repeatedly killing him.

The trouble with time-travel and alternate-reality movies is that they imply an immortality, which drains the tension from immediate events. And in this particular flick, director Doug Liman doesnt place his time traveler in a social or interpersonal context we care about. Theres some amusing moments when the awakening groundhog thumbs his nose at the shadows, but the closest we get to a rooting interest is when Cage flirts with Rita before returning to fight the aliens.

By design its monotonous, and with so much clunky hardware, Liman cant generate the same pace he produced in the Bourne movies. Edge of Tomorrow has neither an edge nor a vision of tomorrow that matters today.

Brief Summary: A soldier fighting aliens gets to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies.

Edge of Tomorrow is one my all-time favourite films, but for years I've had one very specific gripe: In the end, before the final confrontation, Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) leans in and kisses Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) before sending him off to kill the Omega, a sentient alien invader with the ability to control time. Earlier in the film, Cage had died while killing an Alpha, and its blood passed that ability on to him. When we get to this final point in the film, Cage has lived the same day over and over again, and with Vrataski's help has learned about the aliens and how to save the planet from their unfriendly arrival. 

Now, The Final Kiss in an action film isn't really a new concept. I'm pretty sure they only started letting women be in action movies because the trope would be too gay without them. But this particular kiss always sat poorly with me. At a previous battle, Vrataski had also inherited the Alpha/Omega's ability to control time and it helped her lead her troops to victory at Verdun. But when Cage enters the picture, she no longer has that power. Every time we see Vrataski is the first time she has ever met him.

Cage watches Vrataski die again and again. He bonds with her and learns her ticks. He learns about her family, her coffee preferences, her history. He spends months, maybe years, learning about the person that she is and attaching his fate to hers. So wouldn't he be the one to kiss her? After all, she just met him. 

Rewatching the film for this review I realized that even though I still don't love this scene (honestly I think we didn't need a kiss at all) it isn't nearly as incongruous as I'd originally assumed. It is the first time Vrataski is meeting Cage, but she also knows what that experience was like for her and what it means to watch someone you care about die over and over again. She couldn't have known precisely what he's been through, but she'd have known enough to realize that they shared a bond she couldn't see, and how traumatizing it would have been for Cage. Before charging to her death and helping him save the world, that kiss was an acknowledgment of the time she knew they must have spent together, and the danger they must have faced. 
One of the reasons I love this film is that it is such a clear demonstration of how a character can grow. When we first meet Cage he's attempting to desert his military service because he's afraid of being killed on the front lines. But after he meets Vrataski and she teaches him everything she knows, he becomes a soldier in his own right, with his own personal dedication to the cause. It's my favourite Tom Cruise film, and it's the one that turned me around on him as an actor. 

But I also really love this film because it's one that gives a woman authority and means it. After the battle at Verdun, Vrataski is dubbed the ""Full Metal Bitch."" The phrase is scrawled across wartime posters of her face and it's uttered in reverence whenever men see her in the flesh. But even though this movie ostensibly stars Tom Cruise and the story is about his journey, Edge of Tomorrow never undermines Vrataski by having her play second fiddle to Cage. At all points, she is the superior and she maintains her command. Even as Cage uses his powers to learn more and more about the course of the day, he still defers to her authority, even when doing so means letting her knowingly risk her life.

Brief Summary: A soldier fighting aliens gets to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies.

Edge of Tomorrow may sound like the title of a soap opera, but its actually the name of a new and unusual Tom Cruise alien invasion flick. In it Cruise battles nasty space bugs called Mimics but the story is more Groundhog Day than it is War of the Worlds.
Set at the height of a worldwide battle between the human race and seemingly indestructible aliens called Mimics, Cruise plays William Cage, a marketing genius who lost his advertising firm when the world was thrown into chaos following the invasion. He now works for the army, selling war to the masses. Hes inspired millions of people to enlist by telling them the story of hero Rita (Emily Blunt), a legendary warrior with more Mimics notches on her belt than the rest of the army combined.
When he is pressed into active service on the eve of a massive offensive, he proves that while he may be an officer, hes no gentleman. I cant stand the sight of blood, he says trying to weasel out of the dangerous duty, not so much as a paper cut. His cowardly antics get him arrested and shipped to the front lines where, following a wild deployment scene that sees Cruise and Co plunged into Mimic territory, he is promptly killed.
Thats right. A Tom Cruise character in a Tom Cruise movie is killed in the first twenty minutes. But this is where things get interesting, and strange.
Instead of shuffling off this mortal coil, he actually wakes up and starts his journey all over again. Over and over he wakes to the unmelodious sound of a drill sergeant calling him Maggot but each time he has learned something more that helps him cope with the situation.
The only person who believes his strange story is Rita. Together they reset the day repeatedly and start anew with the info hes learned. Eventually hell know enough to beat this unbeatable foe. Trouble is, he has to die every day
Two thirds of Edge of Tomorrow is as Un-Cruiselike a movie as Tom has ever made. The Groundhog Day been-there, done-that section of the film is inventive, often played for laughs and presents Cruise in a way weve rarely ever seen himas a coward. Its a refreshing twist for him and gives him a chance to exercise his rarely used comedic chops. You know hes going to turn heroic sooner or later, but its a blast to see him do something just outside his usual wheelhouse.
Just as important to the film is Blunts take on Rita. This is something different for hershes arguably best known for the comedy The Devil Wears Pradaand for action movies in general. Big budget blockbusters dont usually make room for female characters unless they are sidekicks or girlfriends. Here Blunt avoids being objectified and is as strong, if not stronger than Cruise.
Director Doug Liman has figured out clever and entertaining ways to show the same thing over and over, keeping it exciting with interesting editing and changing perspectives. The first two reels are packed with energy and invention its only when the conventions that made the story enticing are put aside in the last reel that the movie becomes a standard Cruise action flick. A good Cruise action flick but still more standard than the promising first hour.

Brief Summary: A soldier fighting aliens gets to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies.

Though comparisons to the premises of Source Code, recent video games (what gameplay doesnt feature redos?), and even last years Oblivion are inescapable, Edge of Tomorrow doesnt let the recycled concepts hinder the fun. Star Tom Cruise gratifyingly infuses his customarily likeable movie persona into the protagonist, who, through multiple montages of trial-and-error attempts at altering the future, creates an engaging, routinely humor-filled and occasionally bittersweet relationship with costar Emily Blunt. Unexpectedly clever surprises keep the anticipation and mystification rolling, while the action sequences are plentiful and intense  despite arguably uninspired creature designs. Predictably, adequate explanation is lacking in both the extraterrestrial hierarchy and what governs the time travel aspects (rules!), but the films triumph is that most audiences will be entertained to the point that they wont care to pick apart the inconsistencies.

In the ongoing war against a deadly race of alien invaders, Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) revels in promoting the heroic soldiers and aggrandizing the numerous conflicts. But when General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) orders Cage to the frontlines to bolster support for Operation Downfall, a dangerous push across France to corner the Mimic monstrosities, the cowardly soldier refuses. Arrested and sent to Heathrow base, Cage is forced to take part in the invasion as a member of the ragtag infantry unit J-Squad.

After meeting his demise while fighting an unusually large mimic, Cage awakens back at the base, not only alive but also at an earlier point in time, from which he proceeds to relive the day all over again. When he perishes anew while attempting to protect decorated soldier Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), and again finds himself reverting back to a previous point in time, he discovers that his death triggers a loop that allows the day to repeat. With his newfound ability, Cage must continuously retrace his steps to locate and destroy the enemys power source  and find a potential future where Rita survives.

Cruise has once more chosen a project that proves to be superior to the first impressions of the generic trailers, taglines, and synopsis. On the outside, its a Groundhog Day storyline planted firmly in the confines of a science-fiction actioner, which takes the uniqueness of the aforementioned films angle and puts it in common territory. But despite the futurism tropes and the ensuing Normandy Beach-styled alien assault catalyst, Edge of Tomorrow packs numerous twists and gimmicks that surprisingly work in its favor.

Though the visuals include clunky armor like an implausibly more cumbersome Robocop suit, and the monster designs appear borrowed from the squids of The Matrix, its the occurrences of time travel that will stimulate audiences with a mind for complexities and thought-provoking situations. Time is manipulated as a recurring experience rather than traversed with a dimension-transiting machine, while motivations for adapting, learning, and even falling in love are more affecting than explosions or gunplay. For Cage, shock and disbelief morph into memorizations and knowledge (which lend to taking advantage of the scenario) before aspirations of righteousness finally sink in. And at the heart of it all is plenty of humor to complement the suspense, which capably presides over the necessary repetition and aids in simplifying the overlooking of reasoning that haunts the last act. In the conclusion, satisfaction wins out (along the lines of a Hollywood ending) without completely straying from the themes of the source material (the Japanese light novel All You Need Is Kill), though the logic is altogether out of sync with the rest of the universe  and resultantly open for countless interpretations.",EB_Doc3_Though_comparisons_to,Enis Becirbegovic,Sci-Fi,Positive,Edge of Tomorrow

Brief Summary: A soldier fighting aliens gets to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies.

It is difficult, and probably misguided, to vote against the cinematic prowess of Tom Cruise. Despite the fact that a good majority of his headline making in recent years has been for his Scientology beliefs or his occasionally quirky behavior, the simple fact is that Cruise continues time and again to deliver the goods when it really counts.

With Edge of Tomorrow, he does it again.

A surefire sci-fi blockbuster of the popcorn variety based upon a novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, Edge of Tomorrow centers around Major Bill Cage (Cruise), a green military officer more adept at selling war than actually fighting in it. When he inexplicably finds himself forced into battle on the frontlines of a key battle against an otherworldly enemy, he's quickly killed yet finds himself caught within a time loop that leaves him reliving that final day over and over again. Alongside the Angel of Verdun (Emily Blunt), a particularly effective fighting machine, each time he dies leads him closer to discovering the truth about the enemy and finding a way to defeat them.

If there's a beef that I've had with Tom Cruise as of late, it's that too many of his films have seemed more like desperate attempts to stay relevant than actual acting performances. I've missed the Tom Cruise of old, an actor who stretched himself and grew while occasionally failing but never failing to completely fascinate.

While Edge of Tomorrow may not require a master thespian, Cruise's Cage is a surprisingly complex role filled with opportunities to once again flex his acting muscle. This is especially true in the film's first half when Cage is a more humble and vulnerable man repeatedly coming face-to-face with his own mortality and his own limitations. It is in these scenes, which sadly eventually give way to the familiar Cruise strut and smile, that I found myself most enchanted by both the film and Cruise's genuinely appealing performance.

It's going to be interesting to see what America does with this film, a rumored $178 million mega-budget extravaganza opening alongside the $12 million The Fault in Our Stars, a film with big buzz and a huge fan base of 10 million plus who've snagged a copy of Hoosier author John Green's novel of the same name.

This film is directed by Doug Liman, a creative action director who also gave us Mr. and Mrs. Smith and The Bourne Identity. It shouldn't be surprising that much like those films, Edge of Tomorrow creatively amps up the action while infusing it all with wit, intelligence, and formula that doesn't always seem like formula.

If the entire plot around Edge of Tomorrow sounds like a sci-fi version of Groundhog Day, that's not entirely inappropriate. While the film does have that whole ""reliving each day"" theme going for it, much like Groundhog Day there's actually a whole lot more going on than one might think and much like Cage you'll likely find yourself noticing a little bit more with each and every daily journey.

In addition to Cruise's performance that is filled with humor, heart, and bravado, Emily Blunt satisfies in what is most certainly a stretch for the young actress but one done with quite impressive results. Blunt gives an intelligent and gutsy performance that, quite frankly, I wasn't convinced she had in her. Bill Paxton, who seems to be experiencing a career resurgence as of late, is impressive as Master Sgt. Farrell, a Kentucky-bred good ole' boy tasked with preparing his men in J Squad, including Cage, with an impossible task.

Dion Beebe's lensing is dizzying yet emotionally satisfying though, and I know I sound like a broken record, any notion of catching this film in 3-D ought to be tossed out the window. It's completely unnecessary. James Herbert's editing is crisp and well timed, while Christophe Beck's original score weaves its way through the film's darkly humorous terrain.

Edge of Tomorrow is proof, once again, that Cruise can certainly be knocked down but can never be counted as completely out even when it seems that all of America has turned against him.

Brief Summary: A soldier fighting aliens gets to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies.

Critics verdict: This could be the action film of the year. 
Stephen A Russell for thelowdownunder: The words Tom Cruise and blockbuster in combination do not generally fill me with abundant hope. It is a huge credit to director Doug Liman of the original The Bourne Identity, Jumper and Mr. & Mrs. Smith that his latest box office behemoth, Edge of Tomorrow, is an outstanding, balls-to-the-wall action thriller that successfully marries a smart high concept with a refreshingly irreverent sense of humour.
It boasts a cracking script from Christopher McQuarrie, more along the lines of The Usual Suspects than his less impressive recent trio of Jack the Giant Slayer and Cruise vehicles Jack Reacher and Valkyrie. Hes working here in collaboration with brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth, who worked with Liman on Fair Game.
Cruise is unrecognisably self-deprecating here, with the film overtly poking fun at his diminutive stature 
As Edge of Tomorrow opens, the Earth has all but fallen to alien invaders called the Mimics, who crash land via the very 1950s B-movie convention asteroid and have lain waste to Europe. Cruise plays William Cage, a former ad exec press-ganged into becoming the world defence armys spin-doctor. So far, so standard Cruise smarmy.
Rather quickly, however, an abrasive brush with army bigwig General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) sees cage unceremoniously demoted and sent packing to a Heathrow Airport military base where hes suited up in a very Alien-like battle skeleton, or jacket, to be sent to the front line on the beaches across the Channel in France. Heading into the fray with a bunch of die-hard commando-types, it soon turns out that theyve been expected, and the Normandy-like beach landing is an all-out slaughter thats set to wipe out humanitys last stand.
Thankfully, a bit of sci fi hocus pocus means that a suicidal blast from Cage, aimed at wiping out one of the big bad tumbleweed/octopus-cross aliens results in its blood giving him bizarre Groundhog Day powers. Each time he dies, he finds himself right back at the start of battle with the events reset and able to be altered.
Cruise is unrecognisably self-deprecating here, with the film overtly poking fun at his diminutive stature in these early battle scenes during which hes clearly a useless civilian getting wiped out repeatedly. What could have been monotonous is kept lively by rapid editing, often playing visual jokes with what has gone before and incrementally moving the story forward, sometimes in giant leaps.
Slowly but surely, Cage learns how to fight, seeking out the aid of war hero Rita, played with Looper-like hard assery by the always-fabulous Emily Bunt. Its revealed she once shared Cages newfound power and, with the help of Noah Taylors bumbling astrophysicist turned mechanic, she has a plan to seek out the Mimics all-controlling Starship Troopers-style brain bug, the Omega.
The trippy time reset switch is a hoot, and the 3D graphics are mind-blowingly fierce, particularly in the devastating beach battle that plays out as a gore-censored but nevertheless bone-shuddering Saving Private Ryan. A later scene in a devastated Paris is also fantastic, with the frenetic pace rarely letting up, but Liman deftly orchestrates the destruction, ensuring it doesnt sink into mind-numbing Transformers fare. Blunt and Cruise invest a great deal of heart in their action heroics, thankfully minimising the hokum romance angle. The sheer cinematic gold of Blunt repeatedly blowing Cruises brains out, in order to reset the day whenever something goes wrong, never gets old.

Brief Summary: A soldier fighting aliens gets to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies.

Vicious aliens wicked combat and Tom Cruise charm are all good fun, but whats the point when the story makes no sense?

Cruise is Major William Cage. Hes in the army and has a high rank, but hes a man of media relations, not combat. When his superior (Brendan Gleeson) decides its time for the world to see him in battle, Cage finds himself face-to-face with invading ETs donning an ExoSuit equipped with heavy artillery he doesnt know how to operate. Sure enough, hes taken out fast, but then, Cage gets another chance. His death puts him into a time loop, letting him live, die and repeat that same day over and over again, giving him the opportunity to hone his skills and figure out what he has to do to eliminate this alien race.

The world building and early character development in Edge of Tomorrow is particularly successful, making the movie strikingly engrossing right from the start. It opens with an eerily exhilarating montage of news clips chronicling the Mimics arrival, the immediate devastation that follows and then the development of the jacket technology that gives humans a shot.

Theres clearly a laughably steady stream of Cruise-headlining sci-fi thrillers, but theres no denying that the guy is a total natural in that spot. However, its the earlier portions of Edge of Tomorrow, when Cage goes from media relations king to lowly private, that Cruise shows off his best work. He effortlessly sells himself as a smooth-talker who struts around in his crisp, clean Majors uniform with all the confidence in the world, so when that rock-solid composure cracks, the resulting meltdown is especially shocking and hilarious.

Edge of Tomorrow is funnier than one might expect, but Cruise nor the writers ever undermine the fact that Cage is being thrown into a deadly scenario and wont be able to defend himself. Bill Paxtons drill sergeant keeps things light through non-stop over-the-top lectures and outrageous demands while Cruise has Cage shaking in his boots for the entire first act of the film, and the combination lets you enjoy the humor without forgetting the reality of the situation  that Cages future is grim.

By the time Cage is killed, Edge of Tomorrow has already established a comprehensive sense of the state of the world, given you a multi-dimensional main character who youre eager to follow, surrounded him with colorful, unique supporting players and put them all up against a vicious, hard-to-kill alien race. Its no secret that Edge of Tomorrow takes a Groundhog Day approach to its alien war, but that awareness doesnt lessen the excitement of the scenario in the least. Even though you know Cage will eventually die and then get another chance, that first time he wakes up, it will rouse a sigh of relief. Youve come to know and like the guy, and then experienced roughly ten minutes of very intense combat with him. When he comes to safe and sound, youre genuinely pleased to see him alive.

Cages first attempts at figuring out what happened to him and how he can use it to his advantage works exceptionally well. Paxtons unforgettable dialogue makes for an amusing recurrence as do mid-battle deaths and Cages pathetic attempts at trying to convince others hes really living, dying and repeating his days again and again. Its fun for a while, but just before the joke expires, Rita comes in. With Ritas help, Cage can use his condition in new ways, keeping the concept fresh and giving the narrative loads of forward momentum. But then thats it. Roughly halfway through the film, their mission and relationship peak and after that, its a mindless mad dash for the end.

Its as though, all of a sudden, the filmmakers realized they were about 90 minutes into the film and had to wrap it up fast. There are memorable moments in the latter portion of Edge of Tomorrow, namely a smart, well-choreographed race through a hallway where Cage uses past run-throughs to deftly dance around anyone who might get in their way, but theyre short-lived thrills. Eventually, the audience doesnt experience any more time loop cycles. From the viewers perspective, Cage already knows what to do so were just supposed to take his word for it and watch him go through the motions until the end of the film. It isnt engaging and, therefore, far less exhilarating.

Edge of Tomorrow is a puzzle. Cage needs to destroy this alien object called The Omega and he has to figure out how to sneak around the Mimics in order to do it. The movie is most successful when were discovering those paths and techniques right along with him. As soon as it feels as though hes loops and loops ahead of us, the connection to the character and the involvement in the mission dissipates until it disappears completely.

Then, what ultimately puts a stake in the entire experience is the ending. Simply put, it makes no sense  literally no sense  and its devastatingly deflating to be left with nothing in the end.",EB_Doc6_Vicious_aliens_wicked,Enis Becirbegovic,Sci-Fi,Negative,Edge of Tomorrow

Brief Summary: A soldier fighting aliens gets to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies.

Theres no question that Doug Limans Edge of Tomorrow is a solid one hour and 40 minute movie. Too bad it runs one hour and 53 minutes. Smart, funny, exciting and thought provoking, like all good science fiction should, the film delivers everything you could want and more from a summer movie. This isnt a piece of Transformers-like urban carnage but a film that was on its way to reminding us that big entertainment doesnt have to be mindless entertainment  something akin to Spielbergs Minority Report, which Tomorrow has more than a passing resemblance to. Yes, its that good  until the end when were offered up a conclusion that undercuts the films interior logic and simply makes no sense.

Cruise is military media liaison Major William Cage, a spin doctor who could convince you a cloudy day is actually replete with rainbows. Hes been working overtime. An alien race known as Mimics, whirling-dervish, octopus-like metallic creatures, have come to Earth with destruction on their minds. Why theyre here is unknown (As Cage says later when asked, Does it matter? thus addressing their purpose as nothing more than a necessary plot device.) but they seem unstoppable. That is until a new exoskeleton  referred to as Jacket Technology  is invented that turns ordinary fighters into super soldiers. Using this new weapon for the first time an English fighter, Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), wiped out hundreds of Mimics and became a poster child for the war effort. Shes a symbol Cage wishes hed created and he eventually gets to meet her. The head of the international fighting force, General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson), surprises him by placing him on the frontlines of a massive invasion of France that they hope will turn the tide of the war.

What Cage doesnt realize is that this longest day will seem endless to him. Once in the fight, hes quickly killed by a Mimic but not before he ingests some of its DNA. This causes him to have a mental connection with the main organism controlling the enemy. Inexplicably, hes also trapped in a time-loop in which he lives the same day, over and over again yet is able to progress further during that day using the knowledge hes gained in previous ones. As a result he becomes a better, smarter warrior who enlists Vrataskis aid as he finds out she was once stuck in this repeating pattern as well.

Of course, Groundhog Day is the template for the premise and Liman freely borrows from Spielbergs Saving Private Ryan as well during the Normandy invasion of the future, which is repeated time and time again. While Tomorrow has more than its fair share of reference points, that doesnt mean it lacks originality or style. Seeing Cage relive the same day over and over again  it seems like an eternity at times, but not in a bad way  is presented in a darkly funny way thats bolstered greatly by Cruises enthusiastic take on his characters seemingly eternal bad luck. I couldnt help but think of the poor major as Wile E. Coyote, optimistic to begin each new day, only to be blown to bits again and again, yet coming back for more. Its a fun conceit, cleverly executed.

While it would be easy to dismiss this as yet another trademark Cruise role  callous jerk grows a heart  that would be diminishing what the actor brings to the screen. We take for granted the conviction he brings to each role he takes, investing a degree of feeling that helps him create genuine characters time and time again. Cruise may find himself in a bad movie now and again, but to his credit, youll never catch him sleepwalking through a role. Blunt is his equal here, fierce, sexy, smart and determined. She brings a sense of vulnerability to the hardened warrior she plays thats refreshing. And kudos to Bill Paxton who provides ample comic relief as Sgt. Farell, Cages direct superior who gets great glee in lording over the maggots hes in charge of.

Yes, its all good  until the ending. Im not sure if I missed something or not but Liman and Cruises insistence on providing the audience with a happy ending trumps the films interior logic to the point that I felt cheated and a bit angry with the route they took. This error is particularly bothersome because most all of whats in Tomorrow is top-notch. Had Liman stayed the course, hes have made one of the best films of the year.

Brief Summary: A soldier fighting aliens gets to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies.

One year after the aptly named Oblivion, 51-year-old Tom Cruise goes the science-fiction, action-hero route yet again in Edge of Tomorrow, a completely derivative effort already described by many as Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers. If only it were as entertaining as either.
Edge starts out nicely enough with Cruises arrogant Maj. William Cage, a telegenic American enlistment tool at a time when Earth is involved in a Falling Skies-like war of the worlds with mechanical alien thingies, suggesting angry squiggles and called mimics. The mimics have no personality and dart about at alarming speed, skewering their victims with darting, multiple metal limbs ready-made for 3-D.
When coward Cage runs afoul of Brit Gen. Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) on the eve of another Normandy landing called Operation Downfall, he is forced to join J Squad, a bunch of suspiciously familiar loser-grunts (especially if youve seen Aliens), headed by Aliens veteran Bill (Were doomed!) Paxton as Master Sgt. Farell.
On the beach, in his lumbering battle suit, Cage gets wiped out almost immediately, but not before seeing a sword-wielding fighter known as the Angel of Verdun named Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt, looking fit, but also very thin).
Odd thing is Cage wakes up the day before Operation Downfall and starts all over again.
Hey, you have to credit screenwriters Christopher McQuarrie (Valkyrie) and Jez and John-Henry Butterworth (Fair Game), based on the brilliantly titled novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. They figured out a way to write 20 minutes of movie that keeps going back to the beginning and repeating much of the action and dialogue (On your feet, maggot, gets very maggoty).
Each time Cage buys it and wakes up again, he and Rita get a little further on a mission to find the alien omega (i.e., a big blue lava lamp under the Louvre of all places) and destroy it and save the world.
Yes, this movie is as painfully stupid as it sounds, and it has more video game DNA than cinema blood in its veins.
Cruise, who is beginning to look his age, is still in Top Gun mode, cruising London on a Triumph motorcycle. Edge of Tomorrow even boasts a misconceived shout-out to the unfortunate 2005 Steven Spielberg version of War of the Worlds, starring Cruise.
Much of the action is shot by director Doug Liman of the similarly gimmicky Jumper and cinematographer Dion Beebe (Green Lantern) in the cheap, shaky-cam style that has finally begun to go out of fashion. Edge of Tomorrow is two hours of sci-fi, rewind-repeat eye-agony.

Brief Summary: A soldier fighting aliens gets to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies.

Its like Groundhog Day! an audience member shouted, 45 minutes into a press screening of Edge of Tomorrow attended by my friend Eric Snider in Portland. If youve ever wondered why things like Two and a Half Men or Big Bang Theory are the way they are, its because these are the kinds of people that populate our nations focus groups and studio audiences, halfway house residents dictating studios assumptions about the average American. I swear, attend enough press screenings and focus groups, and you will eventually lose faith in the concept of the jury trial.

To borrow a comparison from the grunt that swamp creature made while attempting to ladle grease-soaked popcorn into his maw with a flipper, yes, Edge of Tomorrow is like Groundhog Day. Thats the pitch. Tom Cruise lives the same day  the day of a catastrophic battle against alien invaders  over and over again. Along the way, he meets some badly accented caricatures, hears Bill Paxton repeat a series of aphorisms, falls for Emily Blunt (Player 2, I think her character is called), and slowly but surely gets better at pew pew-ing stuff to death with his exoskeleton thingy.

Groundhog D-Day, 50 First Judgement Dates  glib headline opportunities abound. But to extend the analogy, the major difference between Edge of Tomorrow and Groundhog Day is that whereas Groundhog Day takes a high concept and runs with it, Edge of Tomorrow just sort of tunnels into it. Imagine if Groundhog Day was 90 minutes of Bill Murray meeting with wild-eyed scientists exchanging charts and graphs about what was happening to him and how to stop it and maybe 90 seconds of all the fun stuff, like stealing groundhogs and trying to sleep with random coffee shop women, and you get an idea of Edge of Tomorrow. In Groundhog, the question of why Bill Murray kept reliving the same day was kept satisfyingly unspecified. Because the truth is, we dont really care. We already bought in.

Edge of Tomorrow feels like a million monkeys with a million typewriters on a million grams of mescaline couldnt have come up with it, but unfortunately spends all its style and energy trying to explain and resolve a plot device that weve already implicitly accepted upon buying the ticket. The craft and talent is evident, but its mostly wasted on non-stop exposition in an extended montage about vague aliens.

Every time I bash one of these movies, a commenter will tell me to just shut your brain off and enjoy it, bro!

Yeah, man, Im trying to. Its tough when a movie spends 40 minutes trying to make its dumb plot sound logical. Just make with the alien guts and everyones happy.

I dont go into these things with a checklist, but judging by what Ive enjoyed, I seem to have two basic requirements when it comes to mainstream sci-fi:


1. A big idea to play with. The way Her played with the idea of customizable consciousness or Transcendence played with the idea of the singularity  I dont need a super profound allegory or a ton of character development, just a big sandbox to play in.

2. An interesting antagonist (the good guys are never as interesting as the bad guys in these kinds of movies).

Thats pretty much it. Edge of Tomorrow does a lot of things well, but it fails these basics. Its a device in search of an idea in search of an antagonist.

In Edge, Tom Cruise plays a military PR rep with crushed abalone teeth and a rich malty tan who gets thrust onto the front lines of a war against aliens through his own off-putting assholeism. Like his best roles, in Magnolia and Collateral, his alligator smile and lizard eyes work best when depicting the disingenuous, and hes well cast here. Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson get memorable turns as Cruises commanding officers, while the rest of his squad (J-Squad) is made up of Mike Tysons Punch Out caricatures, folks with veritable fathoms of depth, like the girl with dreads, a fake nose, and a terrible southern accent who calls everyone bitch.

Fine. I dont need to know much about these people. But the film manages to waste a good 40 minutes of screen time explaining a time travel methodology that was more obtuse and convoluted than Scientology dogma. See, there are these aliens called alphas, and others called omegas, and the omegas use the alphas to manipulate time with their blood, and Tom Cruise got infected with their blood, so now hes part of their massive central nervous system and reliving time along with them and you know what, never mind. Its not that its too complicated to understand  I mean, it is  but the bigger issue is that I dont care.

Even with all that tedious exposition, we never get much of a sense of the aliens. I dont mean I needed to know why they invaded Earth or their ten desert island discs or their turn ons, but I left the film not even knowing what their skin might feel like. You get no visceral sense of them  think the meaty chest burster in Alien, or the drool  those little things that make you feel the threat. Edge of Tomorrows aliens, around which the entire movie is theoretically built, are just these semi-abstract Koosh balls made of slinkies that fly (?) around arbitrarily (sometimes in the ground, sometimes in the air). One of the key moments Tom Cruise keeps reliving involves his transport plane being shot down (relax, this is in the trailer). I still have no idea how the aliens managed to do this, because we never once see any of them manning a gun. Do they shoot the planes down with guns, or with fireballs from their mouths or big caustic projectile poops from their cloacas or whatever? I still have no idea. If Im going to be scared of something, I at least want to know what its butthole looks like. Say what you will about Oblivion, the kill-droids were cool as hell  floating shiny iPod droids of fascism, complete with malevolent beeping sounds. Thats characterization. Edge of Tomorrow has virtually none.

As cute and shiny as Edge of Tomorrow is, and for all its cleverly-edited montage sequences, I never felt any visceral attachment to it beyond gee, I sure hope this handsome guy beats this video game. Because thats all it really is, some guy gradually learning cheat codes. Groundhog Day left purposely vague the method of Bill Murrays time travel, and never set an end goal for him to get out of it. He has to explore and gradually figure it out for himself, and you fill in the blanks. In Edge, a random scientist dude literally explains the entire thing in two minutes with an elaborate hologram sequence. Seriously, are the touch screen and holograph industries financing action films? How is it that every single action film of the last ten years manages to include a touch screen sequence?

If the entire plot of Groundhog Day was kill Ned Ryerson, and the movie consisted solely of montages where Bill Murray gets closer and closer to his goal and then finally achieves it, itd be pretty boring. And so is Edge of Tomorrow.",EB_Doc9_Its_like_Groundhog,Enis Becirbegovic,Sci-Fi,Negative,Edge of Tomorrow
60,EC_Doc10_Interstellar_Negative,"Remember Gravity. Remember the simplicity, raw emotion, visual wonder, precision pacing and unpretentious central character in that space odyssey? Hold that thought. Youll need to. Interstellar is no Gravity; its on a different flight pattern.The script, by director/writer Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) and his brother writer Jonathan Nolan, doesnt let the film get off the ground, literally, for 50 minutes. It meticulously, laboriously sets up the back-story and the reason why a trip to outer space is a do-or-die mission. Somewhere in the future, Earth is experiencing severe environmental problems. The romance of the space program has vanished and day-to-day life is a struggle for the basics, like growing crops and surviving devastating dust storms. Its a bleak world, indeed. Theres got to be a better place to live, right? We get it. Our selfish ways and disregard for the environment and climate change will become the bane of our existence. Its not exactly an original premise, but lets go with the flow.Somewhere in farm country, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former astronaut and engineer, is a widowed, semi-contented farmer who grows a lot of corn. He lives with his father-in-law (John Lithgow), young son and moody little daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy). Murph is a bit weird. She thinks there are ghosts in her room who knock books off shelves. No one believes her, but Cooper eventually gets drawn into her world and thinks something strange is going on. He and Murph wind up in abandoned field, where they discover?The long intro, ad nauseam, wears out its welcome pretty fast. It doesnt help that McConaugheys interpretation of Cooper is the same spin he puts on his driver character in those incessant Lincoln MKC car commercials. Its the same, folksy, laconic, soft-spoken, guy-next-door persona. It takes McConaughey almost the entire film to find a full range of emotions for his protagonist and to lose his car salesman shtick. And when he does, its as if hes finally wiped the dog poop off his shoes.Cooper and Murph stumble upon an underground, secret NASA headquarters. NASA has been abandoned and all but outlawed for years. The center is run by a Professor Brand (Michael Caine), who grimly tells Cooper that, according to his calculations, Earth will be uninhabitable in a generation or two. The only hope for humankind to survive is to find a new, hospitable home. Hes got his eyes set on a wormhole near Saturn. Its a tube/tunnel made of spacetime that connects two different regions; theoretically, you could enter one side of the tube and exit the other end somewhere else in another time period. It could lead to a safe galaxy. He wants Cooper to head the mission. Cooper realizes that the expedition is necessary, dangerous and that he may never see his family again. Murphy catches on and doesnt want dad to leave. Cooper departs, leaving behind an angst-riddled daughter.Once Cooper, along with Brands scientist daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) and a small crew leave earth, director Christopher Nolan finds his footing. This is the director of The Dark Knight and Inception. Making a journey to a far off galaxy look visually arresting is his strong suit. Action sequences are solid, from the blast off, to space station landings, to explorations on far off planets. He is far less able at making the characters have an emotional connection that matters. Cooper and Amelia dont jibe. The angry daughter saga goes on far too long (has anyone ever heard of time out?) and well into adulthood when Murph (Jessica Chastain) has become a well-regarded scientist and her brother (Casey Affleck) a cynical farmer.Back and forth scenes between space and Earth, where life in the outer galaxies remains the same and people on Earth age dramatically are fascinating at first. But they go on way too long. In fact at a staggering 169 minutes this well-intentioned film becomes intermittently engaging and lethargic. Youll find yourself alternately fascinated and looking at your watch wondering if you can get home in time for dinner.Two supporting characters were far more interesting to watch than the main cast. Wes Bentley (Cesar Chavez) and David Gyasi (Dark Knight Rises) play crewmembers and their performances are so understated you almost have to see the movie twice to understand how good they are. Hathaway, Caine and Lithgow have been a lot better in other movies. Chastain is fine, though again, she is stuck being angry, a trait that is not attractive. David Oyelowo and Ellen Burstyn have very little time on screen, but work their magic nonetheless. Topher Grace as Chastains love interest is utterly miscast.The sound department must have been paid by the decibels. Did someone think that a deafening noise level could camouflage the slow parts? The set decoration (Gery Fettis, Changeling), production design (Nathan Crowley, The Dark Knight), cinematography (Hoyte Van Hoytema, The Fighter) and special effects are the films strongest assets, Oscar-worthy ones. The shots of Earth, with landscapes on the perpendicular, is a trick Nolan used to better effect in Inception. Film Editor Lee Smith (The Dark Knight) had perfect timing for the space shots and was asleep at the wheel for the Earth sequences.This is an event movie. Its a huge ($165 million budget) endeavor and admirable in a 2001: Space Odyssey kind of way. But compared to Gravity and the sensibility of director/writer Alfonso Cuarn Orozco, Interstellar, though ambitious and thrilling at points, is too complicated and doesnt reach its full potential.Cooper pines, We used to look up at the sky and wonder about our place in the stars, now we just look down and wonder about our place in the dirt. So why did the film spend so much needless time on Earth and not more time in space where it felt so right?",EC_Doc10_Interstellar_Negative,Emily Castanares,Sci-Fi,Negative,Interstellar
61,EC_Doc10_The-Ring_Review_Negative,"THE RING. With Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, Brian Cox. Directed by Gore Verbinski. Running time: 109 mins. Rated PG-13: drug and alcohol content, sexuality, some violence and language. 1 1/2 Stars. The imagination of Salvador Dali meets the supernatural hustle of M. Night Shyamalan in Gore Verbinski's ""The Ring,"" a horror ghost story that figures to become a cult film for the video generation. I hated it, but I grant that it does tap into a vein of technological horror - the fear of the VCR! - that will have young videophiles chatting it up for weeks. It's already generating ""Blair Witch"" buzz on the Internet. Adapted from both a series of Japanese novels and the Japanese film, TV and comic-book franchise they spawned, ""The Ring"" is certainly the strangest movie to come out of a Hollywood studio (DreamWorks) this year. It's an art-house B movie with philosophical pretensions, a murky story line and a disturbing, sequel-promising ending. A terrific lead performance from Aussie actress Naomi Watts, who emerged as a potential star in David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive,"" is about the only thing I enjoyed about it. Watts plays Rachel Keller, a Seattle newspaper reporter and single mom, whose investigation into the death of a teenage niece puts her and her young son's life in jeopardy. In the film's long tease opening, the niece dies of a heart attack exactly seven days after watching a strange videotape and receiving a telephone call giving her a week to live. Ace reporter that she is, Rachel retraces her niece's steps to a wooded motel cabin where she finds the haunted video, and pops it into the VCR for her own viewing pleasure. It's a weird, symbolism-rich short, something you'd see at a festival of bad student films, with Dali-esque images suggesting family tragedy on a horse farm next to the sea. Having received her ""death call,"" Rachel enlists the aid of Noah (New Zealander Martin Henderson), a video expert who happens to be her ex-boyfriend and the father of her psychic son, Aidan (David Dorfman). Of course, he watches it and gets a telephone call himself. Then, Aidan, after sneaking a peek in the middle of a sleepless night, gets his call. ""The Ring"" follows Rachel and Noah as they race the clock to deconstruct the video and take away its power. Their clues are provided mostly by Aidan, who is channeling the ghost of a young girl in the video. Verbinski - who directed the Brad Pitt/Julia Roberts fiasco, ""The Mexican"" - is a fine visual stylist, and ""The Ring,"" shot in the rain and mist of the Pacific Northwest, is deftly atmospheric and genuinely creepy. The editing, full of quick cuts and foreboding, is hip enough for a music video. While ""The Ring"" is a contextual dead ringer for the recent ""FearDotCom"" (sub the video with a Web site), the movie it most resembles in spirit is David Cronenberg's far superior ""Videodrome,"" about a late-night TV program that infects the minds of its viewers. The hallucinatory quality of that film's imagery continues to haunt me, in ways ""The Ring"" never will. But the subsequent video revolution deserves its own benchmark horror film, which the Japanese version, ""Ringu,"" is among Asians, and which Verbinski's could become in the West. ""Ringu,"" by the way, screens next weekend at the Walter Reade Theater, as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center series ""Scary Movies: 30 Years of Horror,"" which begins today.

62,EC_Doc1_Interstellar_Positive,"Christopher Nolans""Interstellar,"" about astronauts traveling to the other end of the galaxy to find a new home to replace humanitys despoiled home-world, is frantically busy and earsplittingly loud. It uses booming music to jack up the excitement level of scenes that might not otherwise excite. It features characters shoveling exposition at each other for almost three hours, and a few of those characters have no character to speak of: theyre mouthpieces for techno-babble and philosophical debate. And for all of the directors activism on behalf of shooting on film, the tactile beauty of the movies 35mm and 65mm textures isnt matched by a sense of composition. The camera rarely tells the story in Nolans movies. More often it illustrates the screenplay, and there are points in this one where I felt as if I was watching the most expensive NBC pilot ever made.And yet ""Interstellar"" is still an impressive, at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan's work melted away. Ive packed the first paragraph of this review with those objections (they could apply to any Nolan picture post ""Batman Begins""; he is who he is) so that people know that hes still doing the things that Nolan always does. Whether you find those things endearing or irritating will depend on your affinity for Nolan's style.In any case, theres something pure and powerful about this movie.I cant recall a science fiction film hard-sold to a directors fans as multiplex-awesome in which so many major characters wept openly in close-up, voices breaking, tears streaming downtheircheeks. MatthewMcConaugheys widowed astronaut Cooper and his colleague Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) pour on the waterworks in multiple scenes, with justification: like everyone on the crew of theEndurance, the starship sent to a black hole near Jupiter that will slingshot the heroes towards colonize-able worlds, theyre separated from everything that defines them: their loved ones, their personal histories, their culture, the planet itself. Other charactersincluding Amelia's father, an astrophysicist played byMichael Caine, and a space explorer (played by anun-billedguest actor) whos holed up on a forbidding arctic worldexpress a vulnerability to loneliness and doubt thats quite raw for this director.The films central family (headed by Cooper, grounded after thedismantlingof NASA) lives on acornfarm, for goodness sake, like the gentle Iowans in ""Field of Dreams""(a film whose daddy-issues-laden story syncs up nicely with the narrative of""Interstellar""). Granted, they're growing the crop to feed the human race, which is whiling away its twilight hours on a planet so ecologically devastated that at first you mistake it for the American Dust Bowl circa 1930 or so; but there's still something amusingly cheeky about the notion of corn as sustenance, especially in a survival story in which the future of humanity is at stake. (Ellen Burstynplays one of many witnesses in a documentary first glimpsed in the movie's opening sceneand which, in classic Nolan style, is a setup for at least two twists.)The state-of-the-art sci-fi landscapes are deployed in service of Hallmark card homilies about how people should live, and whats really important. (""We love people who have diedwhat's the social utility in that?"" ""Accident is the first step in evolution."") After a certain point it sinks in, or should sink in, that Nolan and his co-screenwriter, brotherJonathan Nolan, arent trying to one-up the spectacular rationalism of 2001."" The movie's science fiction trappings are just a wrapping for a spiritual/emotional dream about basic human desires (for home, for family, for continuity of bloodline and culture), as well as for a horror film of sortsone that treats the star voyagers and their earthbound loved ones separation as spectacular metaphors for what happens when the people we value are taken from us by death, illness, or unbridgeable distance. (Pray you never learn just how good it can be to see another face, another astronaut says, after years alone in an interstellar wilderness.)While ""Interstellar"" never entirely commits to the idea of a non-rational, uncanny world, it nevertheless has a mystical strain, one that's unusually pronounced for a director whose storytelling has the right-brained sensibility of an engineer, logician, or accountant. There'sa ghost in this film, writing out messages to the living in dust. Characters strain to interpret distant radio messages as if they were ancient texts written in a dead language, and stare through red-rimmed eyes at video messages sent years ago, by people on the other side of the cosmos. ""Interstellar""features a family haunted by the memory of a dead mother and then an absent father; a woman haunted by the memory of a missing father, and another woman who's separated from her own dad (and mentor), and driven to reunite with a lover separated from her by so many millions of miles that he might as well be dead.With the possible exception of the last act of ""Memento""and the pit sequence in ""The Dark Knight Rises""a knife-twisting hour that was all about suffering and transcendenceI cant think of a Nolan film that ladles onmisery andvalorizesgut feeling (faith)the way this one does; not from start to finish, anyway. Themost stirring sequences are less about driving the plot forward than contemplating what the characters' actions mean to them, and to us. Thebest of these is the lift-off sequence, which starts with a countdown heard over images of Cooper leaving his family. It continues in space, with Caine reading passages from Dylan Thomas's villanelle ""Do Not Go Gentle Into that Good Night"": ""Old age should burn and rave at close of day;Rage, rage against the dying of the light."" (If it wasn't already obvious, this sequence certifiesNolan as the most death-and-control obsessed major American filmmaker, along withWes Anderson.)The film's widescreen panoramas feature harsh interplanetary landscapes, shot in cruel Earth locales; some of the largest and most detailed starship miniatures ever built, and space sequences presented in scientifically accurate silence, a la ""2001."" But for all its high-tech glitz, ""Interstellar""has a defiantly old-movie feeling. It's not afraid to switch, even lurch, between modes. At times, the movie's one-stop-shopping storytelling evokes the tough-tender spirit of aJohn Fordpicture, or aSteven Spielbergfilm made in the spirit of a Ford picture: a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one. Bruising outer-space action sequences, with astronauts tumbling in zero gravity and striding across forbidding landscapes, give way tosnappy comic patter (mostly between Cooper and the ship's robot, TARS, designed in Minecraft-style, pixel-ish boxes, and voiced byBill Irwin). There are long explanatory sequences, done with and without dry erase boards, dazzling vistas that are less spaces than mind-spaces, and tearful separations and reconciliations that might as well be played silent, in tinted black-and-white, and scored with a saloon piano. (Spielberg originated ""Interstellar"" in 2006, but dropped out to direct other projects.)McConaughey, a super-intense actor who wholeheartedly commits to every line and moment he's given, is the right leading man for this kind of film. Cooper proudly identifies himself as an engineer as well as an astronaut and farmer, but he has the soul of a goofball poet; when he stares at intergalactic vistas, he grins like a kid at an amusement park waiting to ride a new roller coaster. Cooper's farewell to his daughter Murphwho's played by McKenzie Foy as a young girlis shot very close-in, and lit in warm, cradling tones; it has some of the tenderness of the porch swing scene in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" When Murph grows up intoJessica Chastaina key member of Caine's NASA crew, and a surrogate for the daughter that the elder Brand ""lost' to theEndurance's missionwe keep thinking about that goodbye scene, and how its anguish drives everything that Murph and Cooper are trying to do, while also realizing that similar feelings drive the other charactersindeed, the rest of the species. (One suspects this is a deeply personal film for Nolan: it's about a man who feels he has been ""called"" to a particular job, and whose work requires him to spend long periods away from his family.)The movie's storytelling masterstroke comes from adherence to principles of relativity: the astronauts perceive time differently depending on whereEnduranceis, which means that when they go down onto a prospective habitable world, a few minutes there equal weeks or months back on the ship. Meanwhile, on Earth, everyone is aging and losing hope. Under such circumstances, even tedious housekeeping-type exchanges become momentous: one has to think twice before arguing about what to do next, because while the argument is happening, people elsewhere are going grey, or suffering depression from being alone, or withering and dying. Here, more so than in any other Nolan film (and that's saying a lot), time is everything. ""I'm an old physicist,"" Brand tells Cooper early in the film. ""I'm afraid of time."" Time is something we all fear. There's a ticking clock governing every aspect of existence, from the global to the familial. Every act by every character is an act of defiance, born of a wish to not go gently.",EC_Doc1_Interstellar_Positive,Emily Castanares,Sci-Fi,Positive,Interstellar
63,EC_Doc1_The-Ring_Review_Positive,"(CNN) -- A videotape that kills you seven days after you see it is that the center of the psychological thriller ""The Ring."" Based on ""Ringu"" (1998), one of the most successful films in Japanese history, ""The Ring"" is more eerie and spooky than it is out-and-out scary -- but oh, is it effective.

Think ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999) meets David Lynch -- then pretend that ""Blair Witch"" was even half as frightening as it was hyped up to be.

Naomi Watts -- who starred in Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" -- plays Rachel Keller, a reporter for a Seattle newspaper whose teenage niece dies mysteriously. After finding out that three other teenagers also suddenly died at exactly the same time, and that all four had viewed a strange videotape seven days earlier, she begins to investigate. Is the story about the videotape just another urban legend? Or is it the real thing?

Unfortunately, rather than finding the story, she becomes the story after she, her ex-boyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson), and her young son Aidan (David Dorfman) all view the tape in question. The clock is now ticking: seven days until they die. Not a good career move.

Whispering 'boo'
Highly stylized and visually stunning, ""The Ring,"" directed by Gore Verbinski, sucks you in slowly, then whispers ""boo"" in your ear just when you least expect it. The highly evocative story is greatly enhanced by Bojan Bazelli's brilliant cinematography, including the actual video itself. (Yes, you do get to see the video in the film. No, you won't die. At least I don't think you will.)

Watts has had a much longer road to fame and fortune then her best friend and fellow Australian, Nicole Kidman. She is excellent in this leading role, which proves that her stellar performance in ""Mulholland Drive"" was not a fluke. She strikes a perfect balance between skepticism and the slow realization of the truth in regard to the deadly power of the videotape.

Henderson does a wonderful job playing the devil's advocate, challenging Rachel's theories at every turn. ""The Ring"" is most definitely Watts' film from beginning to end, but Henderson does an admirable job as the second banana to her showy role.

Young Dorfman, who played Gwyneth Paltrow's son in ""Bounce"" (2000), is completely believable in his small, but pivotal role. Brian Cox also offers a well crafted turn as Richard Morgan, the man at the center of the mystery surrounding the fatal video.

Chill factors
Screenwriter Ehren Kruger, no relation to Freddie, is familiar with spooky topics. His writing credits include the thriller ""Arlington Road"" (1999), starring Jeff Bridges, as well as ""Scream 3"" (2000), featuring David Arquette and Courtney Cox.

Kruger's script begins almost like another version of the ""Scream"" series, with two girls exchanging scary stories. But the tension kicks in quite quickly when their spooky fiction turns into fact.

Also inherent to the chill factor of this story is the fact that almost everyone has an unlabeled videotape lying around somewhere. Add the fact that the people who see the tape know they have only seven days to live (they receive a phone call right after viewing), and the atmosphere gets downright claustrophobic.

There is little violence and no blood in this creepy thriller. It's truly a fascinating mind game that twists and turns itself into your subconscious. You may not be screaming your head off or hiding under your seat during this film, but you'll find it will linger in your mind long after you leave the theater.

Oh, and there is also a nice little twist at the end. Don't leave the theater too early, or you'll be sorry.

64,EC_Doc2_Interstellar_Positive,"There is everything that you will love about Christopher Nolan'sInterstellar,a richly human sci-fi epic that will stay with you long after you've exited the theater and driven home and, just perhaps, gazed out upon a neighboring field or yard or neighborhood and see it through a different sort of lens.You will love the awe-inspiring wholeness ofInterstellar,a simultaneously tragic yet magnificent universe of universes beyond anything you've ever quite imagined. You will love the transcendent lensing of Hoyte Van Hoytema that turnsInterstellarinto one of those rare films that truly must be experienced in nothing but 70mm IMAX. You will love the story even with all its quirks and flaws and melodrama. You will love the science, even in those times when liberty is taken with relativity and even in those times when you are sitting in your seat mumbling to yourself ""I don't completely understand, but wow.""Just wow.It seems appropriate thatInterstellar,which has also picked up Heartland Film's Truly Moving Picture Award, is a wondrously magical yet flawed film because it is about a wondrously magical yet flawed universe where science and belief fitfully yet necessarily co-exist. The film begins at a point in what seems to be the not so distant future, a time when Earth has been nearly decimated by apparent environmental abuse and neglect coupled with a society now more bent on surviving than thriving. We meet the widower Cooper (McConaughey), a former NASA test pilot whose meager existence now is earned as a farmer for a world where corn is the only crop that will survive. Cooper lives in a ramshackle house with his father-in-law (John Lithgow) and two children, 15-year-old Tom (Timothe Chalamet) and 10-year-old Murphy (Mackenzie Foy). Tom seems content with a life of farming, but Murphy possesses her father's inquisitive and feisty spirit, a spirit her school tries to squelch.With his film running nearly three hours, Nolan takes his time establishing the world in which those on Earth now eke out an existence with the threat of annihilation always nearby. With an almost peaceful sense of morbidity, Cooper and Murphy stumble late one evening into what is left of NASA, an agency long since left behind since the world is now more concerned about life on Earth than life beyond it. It is headed up by Cooper's old boss, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), who is served loyally by daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) and a host of others who will become central to the task into which Cooper is called - to discover a new world to colonize either through plan A, transporting those on Earth to said discovered region, or plan b, genetically starting over. Cooper and Dr. Amelia Brand are joined by Romilly (David Gyasi) and Doyle (Wes Bentley) along with TARS (voiced by Bill Irwin), a former military robot turned expedition companion and cinematic comic relief.To explain the film any further feels unjust to the cause of experience it.Interstellarwill most assuredly have its naysayers and, for the most part, I expect most of its awards season applause to come in technical categories, but it is a film that far outshines last season's Oscar-bait flickGravityby leaps and bounds in nearly every way. There will be some tempted to compareInterstellarto2001: A Space Odysseyor, perhaps more appropriately,2010,though either comparison is truly only rudimentary in construction. While Nolan's influences are at times obvious in the film,Interstellaris neither a space opera nor a sci-fi/fantasy flick but instead one of the purest and most thought-provoking sci-fi films to come into theaters in quite some time. As an added bonus, it is also one of Nolan's most deeply felt and emotionally resonant films even if those emotions are, at times, presented with the clunkiness of a space Yugo.While I will confess that I had my doubts about McConaughey going into this film, he has once again proven himself to be twice the actor that Hollywood was allowing him to be until the last couple years. There are two scenes, in particular, where McConaughey's raw vulnerability and ability to embrace both internal and external stillness adds up to some of the most extraordinarily satisfying scenes you could possibly expect from a film that for the most part is epic in nature. Among the females, it is young Mackenzie Foy, as 10-year-old Murphy, who shines the brightest with a performance that is intimate and honest and brilliant all rolled into one. Anne Hathaway is good but saddled with some of the film's clunkiest dialogue, though Jessica Chastain, as the adult Murphy, also shines.There are times whenInterstellar,which Nolan co-wrote with his brother Jonathan, stretches farther than he needs to and weaves in unnecessary action or uncomfortably awkward threads of intimacy and love that go nowhere. A not entirely unexpected appearance by a familiar face about midway through the film feels almost jarring and disruptive to the film's aura, while Casey Affleck, as the elder Tom, seems to be acting in an entirely different movie altogether. While most of my professional peers seem to have appreciated the presence of TARS, I found it to be not much more than a mildly effective novelty.These quibbles, however, are modest at best and they seem almost inevitable in a three-hour film with such grand ambitions and intent. Christopher Nolan has never been one to shy away from reaching for the highest star and, in this case, the highest star is really, really high.Interstellaris a technical marvel, though in the screening I attended it was marred at least modestly by what was either an issue with the theater's audio balance or whoever finalized the sound mix decided that Hans Zimmer's swooping original score was occasionally more important than the actual dialogue.With a Christopher Nolan film, it's almost always true that one expects to be, at least on some level, completely blown away by the experience. While I was immersed in the universe ofInterstellar,I didn't find it to be quite the soul-rattling experience that I'd expected and ultimately hoped I'd experience.Scientists will debate, theologians will contemplate, philosophers will wonder, and cinema lovers will simply bask in the glory of another remarkable Christopher Nolan achievement. While flawed,Interstellaris still a film to be experienced and a film that simply must be experienced amongst other moviegoers on the biggest screen you can find.",EC_Doc2_Interstellar_Positive,Emily Castanares,Sci-Fi,Positive,Interstellar
65,EC_Doc2_The-Ring_Review_Positive,"Unfortunately, The Ring is not nearly as coherent and consistent as The Sixth Sense , which finally did make some internal sense in that the end did not contradict everything that had gone before. By contrast, Mr. Verbinski and Mr. Kruger seem to make up new rules as they go along, with the result that at the final fade-out we are left hanging, able to figure out neither what else is about to happen, nor exactly what has already happened and who is responsible for it.

Still, I found The Ring moderately absorbing, largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound, for which I must thank the direction of Mr. Verbinski, the cinematography of Bojan Bazelli, theproductiondesignofTom Duffield, the editing of Craig Wood, the costume design of Julie Weiss, the music by Hans Zimmer, the visual-effects supervision of Charles Gobson, and the ghastly and ghostly special makeup effects by the renowned Rick Baker. But lets face it: These days Ill go to anything with rising star Naomi Watts in it. Here she does not disappoint, though her role as Rachel, a perpetually overwrought investigative journalist and single mother, is hardly worthy of the break-out talents she displayed in David Lynchs Mulholland Drive (2001). Nonetheless, she gives a charmingly good-sport, Ill-scream-on-cue performance to jolly things along. She is handicapped somewhat by having to tend to David Dorfmans inadequately calibrated performance as Aidan, a creepy child character shamelessly patterned after Haley Joel Osments uncanny turns in both The Sixth Sense and Steven Spielbergs A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001).

The Ring begins with two teenage friends, Katie (Amber Tamblyn) and Becca (Rachael Bella), hanging out in an unattended home and schmoozing about a mysterious tape that Katie had seen with her boyfriend Josh a week before, after which the phone rang and Katie was told that she would die in seven days. The phone rings again after Becca has left Katie alone downstairs, and as we later learn, Katie dies mysteriously, with a ghoulishly contorted expression of horror on her face. We learn that Katies boyfriend Josh has also died just as mysteriously, as have another teenage couple-all four deaths supposedly following the showing of the mysterious tape. For her part, Becca is trundled off to an insane asylum after having discovered Katies body the next morning.


After all this hullabaloo, Ms. Watts Rachel, Katies aunt, enters the scene to attend her nieces funeral and listen to her sisters plea that she get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding all four fatalities. Rachel is initially skeptical of the videotape rumor, but when she accidentally discovers the tape and proceeds to screen it, the phone rings, and her death sentence is pronounced for seven days hence. What alarms her even more is that her son has stumbled upon the tape and seen it, too-and, even more ominously, knows much more about Katies death than all the grownups. Suddenly gripped by constant hysteria, Rachel calls upon Noah (Martin Henderson), her former lover and Aidans father, to help her solve the puzzle. Noah has always been level-headed, as well as an expert in all forms of electronic communications, though also a bit too cynical and irresponsible for Rachels taste.

All this character information is imparted on the fly, amid innumerable ringings of the phone and screenings of the tape, with its signature opening of a ring consisting of two ominously concentric circles which is eventually shown to represent a well cover concealing an old crime that is the key to the mystery. The pacing remains frantically kinetic, with the camera huffing and puffing to keep up with terrified humans fleeing from or rushing toward the frightening unknown. As the contents of the tape are explored for clues to the mortal curse, a strange spectacle of crazed horses on a horse farm owned by Richard and Anne Morgan (Brian Cox and Shannon Cochran) begins to dominate the screen. Madness spreads like a plague from the Morgans to their horses, and to their hallucinatory daughter Samara, a name with an Arabic connotation of death. Through this maze, more metaphysical than metaphorical, Rachel soldiers on with Noah at her side, until the horror engulfs them both. Could this be a parable about the mind-numbing violence and psychosis of the times in which we live and die, as if we were all accursed? Perhaps Ive seen one down movie too many, and The Ring is it. I should add that Jane Alexander, as Dr. Grasnik, makes a late but welcome entrance to clarify and stabilize the tottering narrative, but she is soon gone, and the film is left free to plunge into chaos.

66,EC_Doc3_Interstellar_Positive,"A group of explorers make use of a recently discovered wormhole to overcome the limitations in human space travel and conquer the great distances involved in interstellar travel.In the last decade Christopher Nolan has proven that he is a filmmaker with visionary ideas, and, although his ambition sometimes goes too far, the premises of his films are enormously provocative. In the case of Interstellar , he moves into space with an eye-opening, hypnotic hallucination brimming with metaphors about humanity. It makes us think of questions and answers, and it always answers them. For Nolan, it is the reinvention that underlies the complexity of a scientific profanity with the intellect of Tarkovsky's ""Solaris""; the heart of Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey""; and the cunning of Kaufman's ""The Right Stuff."" For me, one of the boldest science fiction movies I have ever seen; both in narrative and visual terms, along with a precisely executed staging.And that happens when it presents us with a distant future, in which the inhospitable and dusty planet earth is deprived of all its natural resources and humans subsist in the face of adversity. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former astronaut, and his 10-year-old daughter, Murphy (Mackenzei Foy), discover strange signals from intelligent beings that lead them to a secret NASA base. There they are approached by Dr. Brand (Michael Caine), who elucidates the purpose of said discovery: an interstellar mission to find a habitable planet where humans can live. This may sound like a lot of chatter, but Interstellar's narrative enginemethodize the puzzles to reserve as much time as possible with the plot. And everything is impressive. The characters - taking out TARS, the sarcastic robot - express their emotions through the situations of the scenes, and each one of the performances is realistic without giving up the juncture of what happens; like the Hathaway love monologue, adult Murph's (Jessica Chastain) guilt feelings, and even McConaughey's whining. We feel what they feel. In Nolan's world there is a connection between the story that is told and the images that are seen. And let's not forget that this is fiction. In this way, more skepticism is produced than statements of place; however, when science is added to that equation, the solution is intellectually orgasmic.For example, if for a second we forget Einstein's relativity, evolution, the fifth dimension, time dilation, and the twin paradox, this would be a film about the development of human nature and the parent-child relationship when viewed harmed by external factors that challenge intuition, survival instinct and willpower in the face of future anchors. Still a challenge. That's why everything here works in the black holes of apotheosis: a satisfying photograph, the 2-hour edit. 49 min. of footage, the soundtrack, and even the special effects, which make some of the sequences more spectacular than they are. I suspect some viewers will find Interstellar's plotwith a Hollywood cliche that hinders its nuance. But why not? If necessary to connect the spinner. And the concept of the film, in addition to entertaining, is to explain on a scientific basis the unknown aspects of our universe that could happen. And of course, it will happen one day. Perhaps humanity can change consciousness in the face of future misadventures, but, as we do not know for sure, it is better to enjoy the experiences of the present while we travel there, to that catharsis entitled: ""Interstellar"".",EC_Doc3_Interstellar_Positive,Emily Castanares,Sci-Fi,Positive,Interstellar
67,EC_Doc3_The-Ring_Review_Positive,"Remake of cult video turns out to be a very spooky movie
What do you do if a terrifying videotape that's circulating falls into your hands? Do you run? Do you hide? Do you watch it out of curiosity?
Easy: You remake it for $60 million, add ""The"" to the title and remove much of the subtlety that made the 1998 ""Ring"" a phenomenon in Japan and a pass-along cult hit here.
Following up her breakthrough in David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" last year, Naomi Watts plays driven Seattle Post-Intelligencer reporter Rachel Keller. (Apparently reporters at our competition get away with calling their editors some unprintably alliterative names.) She's drawn into an unsettling mystery when her niece dies in what seems like a schlocky urban legend: The niece watched a cursed videotape, and the friend who discovered her body has been institutionalized.
Perhaps you thought Blockbuster's policies were harsh.
Everyone who sees the tape immediately gets a phone call warning them that they'll die in seven days. The doomed people's faces are blurred in photos taken after they've watched the tape. And at the end of the week, they're found dead, faces frozen in grimaces of terror.
It starts like disposably familiar teen horror  scripted by ""Scream 3's"" Ehren Kruger  but quickly becomes an atmospheric and very spooky supernatural mystery.
Rachel finds the motel cabin in the woods where her niece watched the tape with friends. They're all dead, too. But she can't overcome her curiosity, and she watches it. The phone call comes.
Now in a race against time to lay the curse to rest, she shows it to her skeptical videographer ex-boyfriend (Martin Henderson). Meanwhile, her young son (David Dorfman) has begun to have disturbing visions that may be coming from the dead niece. Clues lead Rachel from perpetually gloomy Seattle to a stormswept fictional Puget Sound island, where an angry widower (Brian Cox) lives with an unbearable secret.
""The Ring"" shows surprising restraint for an American remake, effective atmosphere from cinematographer Bojan Bazelli, good acting from Watts and some nice surprises  all without much blood and gore. Yet director Gore Verbinski (""The Mexican,"" ""Mouse Hunt"") just can't adhere to the stillness of Hideo Nakata's original.
Without spoiling the rest, I can tell you that supernatural enhancements  such as ghostly puddles and making Rachel's son a ""Sixth Sense"" type  are the equivalent of telegraphing a KO punch with a big windup. They diminish the story's signature whopper of a scene, one so memorable and skillful that it jolts even the most jaded fright aficionados.
Like director Christopher Nolan's remake of the Norwegian thriller ""Insomnia,"" it makes the tantalizingly implicit explicit, overexplains for spoon-feeding purposes. That's the difference between a good chiller  which ""The Ring"" is, especially compared with the idiot fodder that passes for American horror these days  and an instant classic, which ""Ring"" was.
If you can get your nails on a tape ofthatone, which inexplicably hasn't been released on video here, you'll get a real eye-opener.

68,EC_Doc4_Interstellar_Positive,"Things are not looking good for planet Earth in Christopher Nolans latest science fiction film,Interstellar.Mother Nature has turned on us, making the planet hostile to almost every crop but corn. Its a futuristic dustbowl, and those who have survived struggle to get by as farmers. No one needs engineers or pilots any longer. Dust covers everything. People are starving, including Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former NASA pilot who never had a chance to truly pursue his dream. He is now a widower, living with his two children  a teenage son (Timothe Chalamet) and 10-year-old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy)  and his wifes father (John Lithgow). Though he now makes a living as a farmer, Cooper still dreams of piloting a spaceship. Murph is also a dreamer. She gets in trouble at school for bringing in a book about the Apollo missions, now seen as fabrications according to revisionist historians. They will get a chance to prove those new historians wrong.Co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan,Interstellarpossesses a manifest destiny that recalls some of the greatest science fiction films. The pure joy of exploration, the mystery of worlds beyond our own propels Nolans nearly three-hour film, taking us to Saturn and beyond. Unlike his Batman films andInception,Nolan adds emotion to the mix. At its heart,Interstellaris a family drama about a father separated from his kids as he pursues a way to save them and generations to follow. But can Nolan successfully balance the cool-eyed science of films such as2001: A Space Odysseywith soliloquies about the power of love? There are a few howlers here, but for the most partInterstellaris a resounding and exciting film.After receiving strange clues in Murphs bedroom, Cooper finds his way to the place where NASA is secretly planning a mission to save the human race, one that involves relocating to another world. Led by Coopers old teacher, Professor Brand (Michael Caine) and his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway), NASA has discovered a wormhole near Saturn that leads to potentially habitable planets. They have sent 12 scientists into the hole to explore the planets and now need a pilot such as Cooper to go out and find them. Cooper, ready to escape the doldrums of his life, takes the chance to fulfill his dreams. Murph wants him to stay. Because it is impossible to reconcile the relativity of time, there is a chance her father wont be back for decades, but while she grows old, he wont age. She refuses to say goodbye.Backed by Hans Zimmers haunting score (just a touch reminiscent of the music for2001) and told in an elliptical style,Interstellarliterally takes off when Cooper, Amelia and two other scientists leave Earth for the wormhole. Just as magnificent to watch asGravity,Nolans film benefits from a very strong script. While the dream world ofInceptionlacked any sort of wonder,Interstellaris full of jaw-dropping sequences. While some of the rhapsodizing about the nature of time may seem like empty philosophy, and most of Hathaways lines are leaden,Interstellargives you plenty to think about. Its a very talky film, even if there are plenty of beautiful, silent space shots. But even if the science is fraught with holes,Interstellarstill manages to convince, especially when Cooper and his friends find the alien worlds, each filled with danger.McConaughey continues his career renaissance here with another strong performance as a cocky pilot who abandons his kids to chase a dream and then immediately regrets the decision. Theres the rub. He may never see his family again, yet the reaches of space call to him. McConaughey gives a strongly emotional turn, one that shatters his typical tough guy shtick. When he weeps, you believe it, anchoring a beautifully ambitious movie that may not completely accomplish its goals.Interstellaris Nolan at his most humane.

69,EC_Doc4_The-Ring_Review_Positive,"The Ring seems like the more conventional of the two ghost movies opening this weekend. It even starts like a teen slasher film, with two girls in a spooky house giggling about naughty subjects.
The opening segment ends on an unsettling note, however. We're presented with a mystery -- it's less comfortingly familiar than a goon in a hockey mask -- and The Ring starts to look like something we haven't seen 100 times already.

Or maybe we have. It's just that we've seen it in bits and pieces, scattered among a half dozen or so better movies.

Based on a 1998 Japanese film that became one of that country's highest grossing movies ever, The Ring is, by definition, unoriginal. But though it is often eerily effective, the most interesting parts all are ... well, let's call them homages to other films.
The premise of ""The Ring,"" a remake of a wildly popular Japanese thriller called ""Ringu,"" has the sound of a familiar urban legend you somehow never heard. The idea is if you watch a weird, disturbing videotape, seven days later you die. Imagine if you forget to rewind.

It isn't hard to picture the script pitch meeting. We'll get some teenagers, they'll watch the video, it will be raining all the time and there will be lots of tiptoeing up and down stairs in dark houses. Oh yeah, and we release it right before Halloween.

And in fact, there is an element of formula. All your favorites are here: the creepy, big-eyed kid who whispers freaky predictions, the phone call that makes you jump, the dripping ghost and the farmhouse with a secret.

It's got a simple premise that draws on the irresistible appeal of urban legend: A videotape is making the rounds. Anyone who watches it gets a frightening telephone call. For the next seven days, strange things happen. Then they die.

Rachel Keller, a Seattle newspaper reporter, was the aunt of one of the girls in the opening scene. Four teens had watched the tape together, and all four died the same night a week later. Rachel begins to investigate.

She watches the tape, then shows it to an old boyfriend, Noah. Her young son, Aidan, also sneaks a peek. Rachel's inquiry becomes a race against time. With building tension, the film counts off the days until Rachel is slated to die.

The story occasionally makes little sense, but the mystery and the chills override the confusion. Eventually, a powerful admonition about the treatment of children emerges from the muddled story line. Early in the story, Rachel is late to pick Aidan up from school and barely listens when his teacher advises her to talk with him about what's on his mind. An unloved child turns out to be central to the mystery of the videotape.

When Noah first watches the tape, he describes it as ""very student film."" It's true: Whoever made it clearly studied Un Chien Andalou, Luis Bunuel's disturbing 1929 surrealist collaboration with Salvador Dali. This is but one classic movie that director Gore Verbinski draws on.

The Ring also occasionally resembles The Exorcist in its detached approach and tone, as well as in its tightly wound and uncuddly mother figure.

70,EC_Doc5_Interstellar_Positive,"Interstellaris a visual masterpiece that has a human touch that propels it to greatness.It is perhaps one of the best space movies ever made.Christopher Nolan isnt one known to be taciturn when it comes to his movies. Even his smaller movies likeMomentohave grand structures bolstering their simple plots. However,Interstellaris easily is first brush with the epic  unless you consider the fullDark Knighttrilogy as one. On paper, it should not work. A sweeping narrative covering different times and worlds would be eaten up by audiences. Thats whyGravityfound so much success financially and at the Oscars. But Nolan does something completely different withInterstellar. He introduces science in a way that isnt watered down or ignored. His film, according to astrophysicists, is completely plausible. Though that fact makes the movie a hard one to digest for viewers, the end result is an incredible study of human nature and our desire to survive.Food is running out. The world is becoming overpopulated. The Yankees look nothing more than a high school baseball team. A crop blight is threatening the very existence of the human race. Nolan drops into this terrifyingly realistic future plagued with dust storms and the risk of the world simply ending within grasp. With this, the nation turns its attention to farmers and away from the sciences and engineers to save the world.However, Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey)who was once a pilot for NASA, maintains his faith in STEM. After a dust storm, a mysterious gravitational disturbance leads him back to the formerly disbanded agency. He discovers that NASA, led by Dr. Brand (Nolan regularMichael Caine) and his daughter Dr. Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) have discovered a wormhole. One system with three potential worlds, as Amelia puts. it. Something, or someone, has given the human race a chance to live by presenting them with potential new planets to call home.Cooper is given the seemingly possible decision to leave his children forever, potentially, or save the humanity from extinction. Choosing the latter, he embarks into an incredible mission on the ship Endurance. He, along with Amelia, Dr. Doyle (Wes Bently), and Dr. Romilly (David Gyasi) set off to assess the three worlds to choose where to start a new civilization.Back on earth, Murphy Cooper (Jessica Chastain), who grows up while her father is gone, begins to help Dr. Brand determine the formula to get humans off of earth in a mass exodus.While wormholes and other worlds seem like the work of science fiction, the science is very real. Though throughout the movie it sometimes gets a little confusing, with a little thinking you can piece it together. Essentially, its the Neil DeGrasse Tyson of movies. The science is explained in a non-condescending way.One of the most surprising elements ofInterstellaris not the story or the science, but the sentimentality. Its shockingly emotional and often heartbreaking. In fact, parts of it gutted me. Whether its surprising because of the director or the premise is anybodys guess. However, the grasp it has on humanity is both refreshing and welcome. Especially in the science fiction genre, a human factor is usually missing. But Nolan and the screenplay exhibit human nature for all its beauty and destruction.We have an innate desire to survive. Thats why the people on earth inInterstellarbegin to lose faith in the dream to leave the planet. They are thinking of how they can solve the problems on Earth. The very idea of the movie is thinking of a way to save our race. However, the movie explores the selfish motivations we also innately have. The way it is explored is surprising and devastating.But its not just the screenplay and direction that exudes that. The ensemble was tasked with accessing emotions that humans would actually feel in these situations. Overall, the entire cast is phenomenal. However, there are three standouts for me. The first isMatthew McConaughey. I think its very unfortunate that he won his Oscar forDallas Buyers Club.Not to take away from that performance. His performance inInterstellaris an incredible meditation on one of the hardest questions for humans: how much will you sacrifice for the greater good. There is no better way to show this than when he is watching messages from his kids as the years go by. This is the best performance of his career.The other two performances that stood out were the two actresses that portrayed Murph.Mackenzie Foybreaks any stigma surrounding child actors with a really naturalistic and heartbreaking performance. She has these knowing gazes that foreshadow the scientific curiosity that follows her throughout her life.Jessica Chastainis an incredible presence as the older Murph. She carries over the knowing gazes, but adds the emotional baggage of years of abandonment by Coop. It is easily one of her most memorable performances.Masterpiece isnt a word I take lightly. Ive said it in probably two reviews on this blog (BoyhoodandMoonlight the former Im less inclined to continue using that phrase). However, Id callInterstellara masterpiece of filmmaking. Its as grand as it is introspective and as grounded as it is existential. By the end of the nearly three-hour running time  it goes by in a flash  you feel as if youve experienced something that is so rarely captured on film. If not for the plot or performances, watch it for the stunning visuals that havent been seen on the silver screen since perhaps2001: A Space Odyssey.I think a decade from now were going to look back and wonder how we fell asleep to such a grand and sweeping epic.",EC_Doc5_Interstellar_Positive,Emily Castanares,Sci-Fi,Positive,Interstellar
71,EC_Doc5_The-Ring_Review_Positive,"Weve all had the experience of seeing a videotape were sorry we watched, of wishing we could go back in time and take those unhappy images out of our minds. Its like that for the characters in the supernatural thriller The Ring, only worse. A whole lot worse.

Have you heard about this tape that kills you when you watch it? a bored teenage girl (the movies recognize no other kind) asks her friend Katie in the opening scene. When its over, the phone rings and someone says, You will die in seven days.  The girl giggles and then notices something. Katie isnt giggling.

Yes, friends, Katie has watched this particular tape (which begins with the image of a ring) and has received that very phone call, and no good will come of any of it -- for her or for anyone else. Within scant minutes, the prophecy is fulfilled and the story of that deadly video kicks into a higher gear.

The Ring does the best it can with this splendid premise, one of the creepiest, spookiest notions in years. It came from Japan, where novelist Koji Suzuki wrote the original book, and the film that resulted was such a sensation that it inspired a sequel and a prequel.

DreamWorks acquired the remake rights and, perhaps not surprisingly, gave Ehren Krugers efficient script to director Gore Verbinski, a solid generalist who previously made Mouse Hunt and The Mexican for the studio.

Verbinski is a bit of a rarity these days -- someone who, as his credits show, can be counted on to do a reliable job in a variety of genres. (Which is probably why DreamWorks also used him to spell Simon Wells when the latter faced exhaustion during the making of The Time Machine.)

Having someone like Verbinski in charge of The Ring means that while the premise and his competence ensure that the film will be unnerving, things could be scarier still if a director who lived only to chill the blood was behind the camera.

Its not only Katie, as it turns out, who saw the tape; three of her young friends watched it with her and they all died at precisely the same time exactly one week later. This unsettling coincidence catches the eye of Katies aunt, crack newspaper reporter and single mom Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), whos already been asked by her sister to figure out whats going on.
Also affected by Katies death is her cousin, Rachels young son, Aidan (David Dorfman), a solemn, spooky little person who has I see dead people written all over him.

Ever the intrepid reporter, Rachel traces the tape to the sinister Shelter Mountain Inn and, being a fearless modern person, watches the video (which has something of the look of a bad student film) for herself.

Naturally, things start to happen that convince Rachel this tape is for real. She contacts her video whiz friend Noah (Martin Henderson) and is astonished and chilled to learn that this tape in effect has no fingerprints, no clues as to where it was made.

Rachel perseveres, and her discoveries, which end up involving -- among other elements -- dead horses, a lighthouse, a mental hospital and potent cameos by Brian Cox and Jane Alexander, culminate in a clever enough ending.

The Rings shrewd premise is fueled not only by the omnipresence of video copies that turn up in our lives from who knows where, but also by a particularly modern feeling of powerlessness, by a sense that forces out of our control have a profound and unhappy effect on our lives.

One of the keys to making The Ring work as well as it does is the strong performance by Watts, who came to prominence with her dual role in David Lynchs Mulholland Drive. Its up to her to lend credibility to this strange scenario, and her presence succeeds in making us believe.

Helped as well by the foggy atmosphere of its Pacific Northwest setting, The Ring is certainly acceptable. But no one seeing it is going to feel as spooked as executive producer Roy Lee, the man who introduced the film to DreamWorks, did when he first saw the Japanese version. He was so scared, he told a reporter, that he simply turned off the movie, and more than once.

To make an audience feel that intensely, you need a different kind of director and a different kind of film.

72,EC_Doc6_Interstellar_Negative,"As someone who never reads reviews and rarely watches trailers before reviewing a film, it was, nonetheless, all but impossible to avoid the buzz surrounding Christopher Nolans first film post-Batman, with the sci-fi epicInterstellar, penned alongside his brother Jonathan, breathlessly dubbed amasterpiece,in some corners.Imagine my surprise, then, when a flustered check of my watch as the film finally kicks into orbit revealed were already at the 90-minute mark  its almost three hours long.Matthew McConaughey is Cooper, a former NASA pilot who, like the rest of the world, has been grounded on an Earth thats slowly choking to death. As crops fail wholesale, the only job that matters is tending to the dying land. Its an interesting enough, if not entirely original, concept that plays on the current political, social and environmental dramas surrounding the current threat of climate change. Unfortunately youll get scant detail here, beyond one intriguing nugget that history has been re-written to suggest the moon landings were faked, in an effort to refocus school kids on the earthly matters at hand.Instead, we mostly focus on a love story between father Cooper and daughter Murphy, played by a red-haired and full-lipped Mackenzie Foy as a child and the talented Jessica Chastain as a woman. Other family members, including son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow), barely get a look in.Eventually they are left behind as fate, and a truly odd sequence involving dust and seeming poltergeist-tossed books, leads Cooper to humanitys last hope  a secret NASA space mission run by Michael Caine thats shooting for a wormhole created by strange, otherworldly beings who can manipulate gravity, opening up the real possibility of habitable planets far beyond humanitys current reach.The cardboard cut out family is replaced by cardboard cut out astronauts, played with a truly odd lack of depth by Anne Hathaway, David Gyasi and Wes Bentley, plus the welcome vocal talents of Bill Irwin as seriously snarky robot assistant TARS who ironically provides the films only human touch. And thats part of the problem here  none of these characters feel fully-fledged, not even Cooper (stoic hero) and Murphy (whiny kid). Theyre here to fulfil dramatic purpose, rather than explore genuine emotional depths. Indeed, for a film so rife with schmaltzy musings on the meaning of life, its alarming how lacking it is in this department and certainly makes the inordinate run-time a big ask.Where it excels, eventually, is in the truly breathtaking journey into the stars and beyond, with Nolan once again pulling out theInception-style wow factor, this time on 70mm film, thats missing in his more grounded superhero movies. But even here it feels a little like cheating, owing a huge visual debt to2001: A Space Odysseyalmost to the point of plagiarism, particularly with the spinning space station.While both planets visited, a tsunami-plagued waterworld andHoth-likewasteland complete with frozen clouds, are pretty to look at, again, theres very little to these adventures. Major incidents occur, but their effect is scantly grappled with, beyond a nice focus on gravitys influence on time, meaning that their families back home age much more rapidly in their absence.Again, other than a few (illogical) video messages that I doubt would have been approved by executive producer Kip Thorne, the celebrated theoretical physicist, this isnt really capitalised on. The emotive stuff rarely moves beyond Hallmark platitudes about a father saving the world for this daughter, hammered home by repetitive and awkward quoting of Dylan ThomassDo Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night. Its left to Hans Zimmers startling,organ-led scoreto do much of the heavy lifting.Never quite as clever or as emotionally engaging as Nolan clearly thinks it is, there is awe here, but no real wonder. In truth, its closer in tone to last years technically excellent, thrilling if not fulfillingGravitythan it is to Kubricks grand space opera. While it will no doubt find willing audiences and rightfully soar in the technical categories of the Oscars,Interstellarultimately comes back down to earth with a thud, and a feeling that its one very expensive bucket of popcorn, leaving you hungry for something more nourishing.",EC_Doc6_Interstellar_Negative,Emily Castanares,Sci-Fi,Negative,Interstellar
73,EC_Doc6_The-Ring_Review_Negative,"To describe The Ring, two adjectives leap to mind: spooky and lame. The former refers to the tone and atmosphere, which are about as good as it gets for a ghost story. The latter refers to the storyline, which is about as poorly constructed as can be imagined  a sad amalgamation of irritating contrivances and gaping plot holes that defy even a generous attempt to suspend disbelief. And, while I normally appreciate open-ended motion pictures, The Ring takes things too far by leaving about 75% of its questions unanswered. This isn't an artistic choice; it's screenwriting sloppiness, and it results in a profoundly dissatisfying experience.

I knew the moment I exited The Ring that I didn't like the movie, but the gloomy atmosphere is so seductive that it took me a while to realize why. The problem lies in the storytelling. The Ring is an incoherent mess, and the more you reflect upon it, the less credible it becomes. (Note: I'm using the word ""credible"" within the context of the horror/ghost story genre.) The movie seems to have been slapped together without concern about whether anything makes sense. The twist ending feels like something grafted on, and it left me with a question about which was more absurd  the revelation discovered by the main character or the manner in which she makes the discovery.

People who are easily unsettled by ghost stories will be freaked out by The Ring. Director Gore Verbinski has studied the masters and understands exactly what it takes to create the perfect ""boo!"" moment. The loud noise, the sudden movement, the musical stinger  they're all there, and Verbinski employs them with enough skill to apply the ""gotcha!"" to even the most jaded, veteran horror fanatic a time or two. Unfortunately, that's about all this movie has going for it  quick, cheap thrills. The Ring is a remake of a Japanese movie that I have not seen. Fans of the original swear by it, which leads me to believe that it must be a lot better than the American version.

The film postulates the existence of a video tape that, when watched, means death to the viewer. The moment the tape ends, anyone having enjoyed the surreal images represented on it receives a phone call informing them that they have one week to live. Exactly seven days later, they die, and nothing they do can stop the Grim Reaper. When a skeptical Seattle-based investigative reporter, Rachel (Naomi Watts), learns about the tape, she tracks it down and watches it. Shortly after being marked for death, she becomes a believer. So, with the help of her ex-boyfriend, Noah (Martin Henderson), who has also seen the tape, she begins an investigation to unravel the mystery before her time runs out. Along the way, a horrifying thing happens  Rachel's young son, Aidan (David Dorfman), sees the tape, sealing his fate.

If you were a mother who believed that watching a tape could result in a death sentence, would you leave it in a place where your son could view it? This is only one of numerous obvious problems with The Ring. The movie is so intent upon unsettling us that it loses sight of credibility issues like this one. Rachel's investigation is a follow-the-dots exercise in coincidence and contrivance, like a gothic version of bad Agatha Christie. The Ring has its share of memorable moments  the opening sequence with the girls watching TV and the horse-gone-wild on the ferry stick in my mind  but the connective tissue is Swiss cheese. And, when all is said and done, a whole lot of what has transpired doesn't make any sense.

Naomi Watts, making her follow-up to David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, is suitably appealing as Rachel. (Is it just me, or does Watts resemble a blond version of her friend, Nicole Kidman?) Martin Henderson is fine as her ex-boyfriend and investigative partner. And Brian Cox has a chilling cameo. Unfortunately, the other key player, child actor David Dorfman, is a blank slate. He comes across as a knockoff of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense  and that's a performance I wasn't terribly excited by in the first place.

I don't recommend The Ring, but it's the kind of movie that could play well to small groups watching it on TV with all the lights out. At least there's no overload of gore  Verbinski has elected to go the suspense route. Unfortunately, he has such a weak script that his efforts amount to a not-so-triumphant victory of style over substance.

74,EC_Doc7_Interstellar_Negative,"Preposterous, pseudointellectual, poorly constructed, clichd, impenetrably masculine, goofy and possessed of an indecipherable ending,Interstellaris the mother of all misfires. It is a bloated juggernaut of stupidity, rolling its obese body stuffed with melodramatic subplots towards a conclusion that would have been laughed at had it been anyone other than writer/director Christopher Nolan who pitched it. Irritatingly, because Nolan has endeared himself to a loyal legion, the film will have its defenders and apologists. They will be wrong.Interstellaropens well enough; set some indeterminate time in the near future, climate change has borked the planet into full-on disaster. Those who can must grow crops in order to feed whats left of humanity. This includes Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former NASA pilot and single father of two. His young daughter, Murphy, tells Cooper that she has a ghost that haunts her room, pulling books off the shelf in an attempt to send her messages. Turns out, within her bedroom is a gravitational anomaly that spells out coordinates.Cooper follows said coordinates and discovers a secret NASA facility that intends to shoot a spaceship into a wormhole to find a planet that can sustain humanity. The leader, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), asks Cooper to pilot the ship, accompanied by three other astronauts, including Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), the Professors daughter. The voyage means traveling through space in such a way that those aboard age slower relative to the folks at home. For the rest of the movie, we follow not only the alternatingly macabre and silly space misadventures but also Coopers kids, Murphy (Jessica Chastain) and Tom (Casey Affleck), as they age on earth and cry a lot.In fact, if there is one defining characteristic ofInterstellarit is weeping; nonstop, grating, irritating weeping. As though the set were built on a bed of freshly cut onions, Nolan confuses having people act sad with making his audience feel something. McConaughey cries like 50 times, Hathaway cries, Chastain cries, Affleck crieshell, Michael Caine cries. And hes British. They dont do that. It is as though Nolan is some kind of overly intellectual alien attempting to learn emotions. Why human cry? Human sad? Oh, human cry when sad! This would explain the scene in which Hathaway attempts to describe love as a function of quantum physics.The worst part, hands down, is what will be referred to as the twist. It isnt a twist, however, as it takes anyone who has seen a sci-fi movie literally 5 minutes to know the ending. Oy vey and that ending For the record, Mr. Nolan, having a character spout nonsense gibberish about fifth dimension temporal understanding is no different than saying ta-da! Magic! Looking no prettier than the TV show Cosmos and not as space-terrifying asGravity,Interstellaris easily the years biggest disappointment and the shiniest turd several hundred million can shine.Inceptionwas proof that Nolan is capable of constructing a vastly entertaining and original, intelligent blockbuster;Interstellarmakes me want to watchInceptionagain.",EC_Doc7_Interstellar_Negative,Emily Castanares,Sci-Fi,Negative,Interstellar
75,EC_Doc7_The-Ring_Review_Negative,"Ehren Kruger (no relation to Freddy) showed a genuine gift for suspense and character in 1999's ""Arlington Road"", but his efforts since then (""Scream 3"", ""Reindeer Games"") have been disappointing. With ""The Ring"", Mr. Kruger adapts the 1998 Japanese film ""Ringu"" which spawned two sequels and was itself based on a novel. Admittedly, Mr. Kruger gives it the old college try. But there's no saving the fact that the film simply has a silly premise: you watch a videotape that contains about 4 minutes worth of creepy imagery (though it's nothing compared to a Nine Inch Nails or Marilyn Manson video). When the tape is done, your phone rings. When you pick on the phone, a girl's voice says ""seven days"" - meaning, you have seven days to live. And sure enough, exactly seven days later your dead body is found doing an impression of Munch's ""The Scream"".

Okay, where do I begin to mock this plot? What if you watch the tape twice, do you get three and a half days then? If you fast forward through it do you get fourteen? How about pausing it to go to the bathroom? Or only watching half, getting bored and turning it off? Not to mention the obvious: don't answer the phone! This is the stuff of urban myths and certainly with Mr. Kruger's background, he recognizes this. He gives us an effective opening scene, which is itself an homage to ""Scream"" that the rest of the film never matches. And then Mr. Kruger has the unenviable task of explaining all the goings-on in the film. Obviously, with a premise like that one, no amount of explanation is going to suffice, and the more and more he tries, the more the film loses its grip on reality and therefore any real scares.

Aptly-named director Gore Verbinski turns out to be surprisingly adept in presenting unsettling imagery and atmosphere considering his credits include ""Mouse Hunt"" and ""The Mexican"". Perhaps more kudos should go to cinematographer Bojan Bazelli whose work on ""Pumpkinhead"" and ""Body Snatchers"" no doubt came in handy. Regardless of their pedigree, however, both men are working in top form to give Mr. Kruger's script far more dignity than it deserves.

The cast, led by Naomi Watts, also invest their all in the story. After David Lynch's elliptical ""Mulholland Drive"", Ms. Watts (sort of a working class Nicole Kidman) proves she can carry a film, though I'm not sure which of these two movies made more sense. Young David Dorfman takes the Haley Joel Osment role as the obligatory boy who knows too much. And Martin Henderson gets by on a smirk as the skeptical boyfriend.

In the end though, there's really very little to like about ""The Ring"". The film is eerie for the sake of being eerie. The plot holes are so many and so frequent that the mind buzzes, and you walk out not feeling frightened but bewildered. And of course there's that nagging notion that the premise itself is just plain idiotic. I suppose the scariest part of the film is the fact that I paid to see it.

76,EC_Doc8_Interstellar_Negative,"Historically, I like Christopher Nolan. I consider him one of the few true auteurs in modern cinemaauteurship being defined as more than just a distinctive visual style, but as having a unifying philosophy or narrative principle uniting a filmmakers work; in Nolans case, its identity and the various ways in which we shape and reveal them. ButThe Dark Knight Riseswas a mixed bag andInceptionis a case of diminishing returnsonce you know how the plot works, sitting through all the exposition in that movie is an exercise in tedium. And it seems like, the bigger his movies and budgets have gotten, Nolan is maybe losing something of himself in the process, that in telling BIG stories, hes forgetting to tell GOOD stories.Interstellaris set in the near-ish future in which it is implied that climate change has gotten the better of us and were stuck in a global dust bowl that is slowly starving the human race. Theres some really great world building in the first act, establishing a world in which any science that isnt focused on food production is being marginalized, and most kids are being trained as farmers, not allowed to pursue higher education or individual goals. Its a frankly terrifying vision of the future handled in the least terrifying, most mundane way, which makes it all the more effective.The story revolves around Cooper (an extra-crispy Matthew McConaughey), a former NASA pilot whos been shunted into a farmers life. He has two kids, Murph and The Boyhis name doesnt matter because hes completely superfluousand a dead wifebecause Christopher Nolan. The only crop left to farm is corn, and its only a matter of time before blight wipes it out, too. Seriouslythe world building is pretty great in these scenes.As a child, Murphs bedroom is plagued by a ghost, but because Cooper is a folksy genius he realizes that the ghost is actually a gravitational anomaly and that its revealing coordinates to a secret underground NASA base. Errsure. Like most of Nolans movies, were asked to make some pretty big logic leaps, and this is the first of many inInterstellar. (The reasonThe Prestigestands out as one of Nolans best is because the only really big leap of logic is that Nikola Teslas duplication machine works, and then its never explained, the film simply commits to the idea that it does work, and the audience follows.)Michael Caine shows up to deliver some expositiontoInterstellars credit, it handles this better thanInceptiondoesand Cooper leaves his family to pilot the last rocket ship humanity has in the hopes that previous explorations may have found habitable planets on the other side of a black hole. The story gets a loosey-goosey in order to get Cooper into space, but once he goes things tighten back up for a bit until ultimately falling apart completely.I wont shit on this movie for having Big Ideas, or for trying to present Big Ideas and theoretical science in engaging ways. Nolan doesnt treat his audience as dumb and thats greatmore filmmakers, especially at the blockbuster level, should have such faith in the viewing audience. And theres a lot aboutInterstellars space science that I likethe spherical black hole, the giant waves on the water-planet that sits next to the black hole, the commitment to relativity around a black hole. But then Nolan starts trying to solve quantum mechanics and shit just goes sideways. At the point that Cooper is falling through a black hole and the truth of Murphs ghost is revealedInterstellarhas become irrevocably silly. As my friend Meghan points out over at Decider, Plan B to save humanitymakes no goddamned sense.At nearly three hoursInterstellaris a slog, too. Itd be one thing if all parts of the movie were equally engaging, but they arent. Jessica Chastain as the adult Murph and Casey Affleck as The Boy Grown Up are pointless. The stakes are established in act one, we dont need to keep revisiting Coopers grown family to be reminded whats on the line for him, or for humanity. In one sequencethe most thrilling of the entire movieeverything is going to shit in space but we keep cutting back to crappy Earth and its crappy problems, which we already know all about. It doesnt matter that the Cooper family farm is dyingwe knew that in the first ten minutes of the movie. What matters is whether or not Cooper and his robot sidekick can save the spaceship.Also, casting an actor of any prominence in a small role in a movie like this guarantees that character is going to be a bad guy. The minute Matt Damon appeared it was blatantly obvious he was going to turn out to be a nutjob who tries to kill everyone. Its like Robert Redford showing up in a Marvel movieOF COURSE hes the bad guy. If it was just an expository role, any character actor would do. But a big A-list name used in a small part that enters in act two or later is always a villain.And thats pretty muchInterstellarin a nutshell. Ambitious and yet completely pedestrian. Great technical aspects undercut by a silly story. Good acting wasted on underwritten characters. Big Ideas served in a movie that is ultimately unsatisfying.",EC_Doc8_Interstellar_Negative,Emily Castanares,Sci-Fi,Negative,Interstellar
77,EC_Doc8_The-Ring_Review_Negative,"Rarely has a more serious effort produced a less serious result than in ""The Ring,"" the kind of dread dark horror film where you better hope nobody in the audience snickers, because the film teeters right on the edge of the ridiculous.

Enormous craft has been put into the movie, which looks just great, but the story goes beyond contrivance into the dizzy realms of the absurd. And although there is no way for everything to be explained (and many events lack any possible explanation), the movie's ending explains and explains and explains, until finally you'd rather just give it a pass than sit through one more tedious flashback.

The story involves a video that brings certain death. You look at it, the phone rings, and you find out you have seven days to live. A prologue shows some teenage victims of the dread curse, and then newspaper reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) gets on the case, helped by eerie drawings by her young son, Aidan (David Dorfman).

The story has been recycled from a popular Japanese thriller by Hideo Nakata, which was held off the market in this country to clear the field for this remake. Alas, the same idea was ripped off in August by ""feardotcom,"" also a bad movie, but more plain fun than ""The Ring,"" and with a climax that used brilliant visual effects while this one drags on endlessly.

I dare not reveal too much of the story but will say that the video does indeed bring death in a week, something we are reminded of as Rachel tries to solve the case while titles tick off the days. A single mom, she enlists Aidan's father, a video geek named Noah (Martin Henderson) to analyze the deadly tape. He tags along for the adventure, which inevitably leads to their learning to care for one another, I guess, although the movie is not big on relationships. Her investigation leads her to a remote cottage on an island and to the weird, hostile man (Brian Cox) who lives there. And then the explanations start to pile up.

This is Naomi Watts' first move since ""Mulholland Drive"" and I was going to complain that we essentially learn nothing about her character except that she's a newspaper reporter--but then I remembered that in ""Mulholland Drive"" we essentially learned nothing except that she was a small-town girl in Hollywood, and by the end of the movie we weren't even sure we had learned that. ""Mulholland Drive,"" however, evoked juicy emotions and dimensions that ""The Ring"" is lacking, and involved us in a puzzle that was intriguing instead of simply tedious.

There are a couple of moments when we think ""The Ring"" is going to end, and it doesn't. One is that old reliable where the heroine, soaking wet and saved from death, says ""I want to go home,"" and the hero cushions her head on his shoulder. But no, there's more. Another is when Aidan says, ""You didn't let her out, did you?"" That would have been a nice ironic closer, but the movie spells out the entire backstory in merciless detail, until when we're finally walking out of the theater, we're almost ashamed to find ourselves wondering, hey, who was that on the phone?

78,EC_Doc9_Interstellar_Negative,"Interstellar isnt interminable. It only seems that way. Further, it only seems that way during the second hour. Thats the Geeks Gone Wild part during which some intrepid astronauts do some extremely high-tech fiddling around with fancy dials. They also engage in daunting sci-fi dialogue about relativity, space-time continuums and all that other stuff that made many of us so very glad wed chosen English Lit as our college major. And then theres oft-uttered word gravity. Which is too bad since every time someone says it, you tend to flashback to last years award-winning lost-in-space epic starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.That said, director Christopher Nolan is incapable of making a bad film. Not even Inception was a stinker, just a too-gimmicky disappointment. Memento, which Nolan co-wrote with his brother (theyve re-teamed here), is one of the best pictures of the 21stCentury. And lets not forget that little franchise known as Batman, which grossed so many gazillions that Nolan has pretty much been given a free rein to do whatever he wants.Hence, Interstellar which is okay at almost three hours and probably wouldve been superb at closer to two.The film certainly doesnt lack ambition or imagination. It begins in a distressing near-future  maybe around 2050. As our hero Coop (Matthew McConaughey) tells us, mankind became so obsessed with its gadgets that it forgot about the basics. Like, say, food. The entire world has regressed into a monumental Dust Bowl, which means several CGI dust storms worthy of Hal Ashbys Woody Guthrie movie, Bound for Glory (which was not CGId).So farming is the name of the game. Almost everyones game. Coop, who once upon a time was a NASA astronaut, now raises corn and lives in a beaten-down clapboard house that makes Dorothys Kansas digs looking positively palatial. He is also a widower, his wife having died from an aneurism that, back in the day (say 2014), mightve been cured. But in this barren new world, MRIs are as common as unicorns.Nolan creates this distressed future with the same expertise he brought to his Gotham City. Coop and his family  father-in-law John Lithgow, son Timothee Chalamet and, most especially, daughter Mackenzie Foy  wander around a kitchen straight out of a Lassie episode. Then, they pull out a laptop to look up something. Its a brilliant juxtaposition: The Grapes of Wrath meets The Matrix.You may want to toss Poltergeist in there as well. Something  someone?  is messing with little Foy. They  it?  dont do any harm, but when she goes upstairs to bed, she finds her books tossed off their shelves and thrown randomly around the room.Thats truly about all you should know except that  as the title, the reviews, the talk-show circuit and the trailers have already revealed  we will end up in outer space. From there, the movie gets quite complicated  and, as best it can, spiritual and metaphysical.Interstellars fault lies not in the stars human or intergalactic. Theres not a weak link in the cast. McConaughey does his sexy-smart drawling Everyman as well as ever and hes ably supported by Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain and a half dozen others in lesser roles. The problem isnt in the execution either; youd be hard put to find a film as expertly made as Interstellar.But quite simply, Interstellar attempts to stake out a claim on our hearts as much as our heads and it cant quite pull it off.In Memento, Nolan nailed feelings of loss and despair and the myriad ways in which coping methods can manifest themselves as well as youll ever see.Interstellar just has too much story to tell, too many characters to juggle and too little emotional resonance. Which would be fine if Nolan were Stanley Kubrick (as in 2001) and didnt give a rats ass about how an audience feels.But Nolan does (to his credit) and his failure to engage us as fully as he intends is all too reminiscent of what was lacking in Inception. He takes us to infinity and beyond, but its likely you cared more about Buzz Lightyear than you will about anyone in Interstellar.",EC_Doc9_Interstellar_Negative,Emily Castanares,Sci-Fi,Negative,Interstellar
79,EC_Doc9_The-Ring_Review_Negative,"Just labeling the new horror film The Ring an urban-legend movie makes it sound a lot riskier than it is. Although it's based on a blockbuster Japanese film series (derived from a Japanese novel series) about a videotape that kills, what we have here is a suburban-legend movie stripped of rough edges and cut off from any depth that might have made it insidiously haunting.

When I think of an urban-legend movie, I think of resonant junk like the Chicago-set Candyman, which shamelessly played on our fear of public housing. In The Ring, the heroine, a hard-driving newspaper reporter named Rachel (Naomi Watts), resides in damp Seattle; so does her bohemian photographer and video-geek ex-lover Noah (Martin Henderson). But she lives the careerist, solipsistic life that two decades ago gave young urban professionals a bad name (yuppies). And, after Rachel learns that the tape might have killed her niece, the action unfolds in picturesque areas she reaches in eye-popping car rides and a ferry trip.

More important, as the movie unravels, it grows less connected to our common phobias and more to our memories of gothic movies. The Ring does have a great gimmick, and it never stops working. According to the myth, after anyone watches a certain unmarked videocassette - containing ersatz-David-Lynch images of alienation and decay - the phone rings, a ghastly voice hisses ""seven days,"" and the viewer dies within a week.

But, as in Poltergeist, another movie with a demonic-video come-on, the main action becomes a melange of spectral vengeance, this time rooted in such routine Halloween settings as a lonely mountain cabin, a ravaged horse farm, and a forbidding mental institution.

For horror kitsch to become classic, it needs to hook an audience's group conscience or psychology, the way Rosemary's Baby played on parents' fears of how their unborn children will turn out. The Ring doesn't have the wiliness or conviction to exploit either a single mother's guilt over child neglect or our collective queasiness over potential bad seeds. It merely alternates these themes and toys with them.

Rachel's sleek shallowness is apparent right from the start. Talking to the concerned teacher of her young son, Aidan (David Dorfman), she breezes by the fact that her dead niece was the boy's best friend until the teacher provides evidence that Aidan has started to act like the kid in The Sixth Sense. Even after Rachel grows convinced that the killer tape has offed her niece and that Aidan has cottoned on to the murder, she puts him in danger.

But it all plays out on the level of a plot hook, like the missing-son subplot in Minority Report, another DreamWorks production. And you can't resent Rachel's drive, because that and Watts' own fervor in the role are all that keep the movie going. Of course, Watts can't deliver the brilliance she showed in Lynch's Mulholland Drive; it's more like the Witherspoonesque glitter of an actress champing at the bit for stardom.

Happily, the work of director Gore Verbinski belies his first name. Even when the body count rises and the action becomes disappointingly banal, he avoids the blood effects. He gets the audience to jump with jolting shifts of perspective achieved by roller-coaster camera moves.

But Ehren Kruger's script is the terror-film counterpart to last spring's romantic fizzle Life or Something Like It, which also focused on a careerist Seattle journalist (Angelina Jolie) and a tousle-haired cameraman (Edward Burns) who helps her out when she thinks she has one week left to live. There's more life, or something like it, in The Ring. But not enough.

     Brief Summary: John Wick serves up a noxious, clashing blend of hyper-realistic and cartoonish violence. Too bad there's no cinema decontaminating service that can wash our memories clean of such useless gore. 

About 90 minutes into the non-stop bloodbath that is John Wick, a Russian mobster begs the vengeful title character ""No more guns! No more bullets!""

It's a plea that any sentient being watching the film might have made about an hour earlier. (*  out of four; rated R; opening Thursday in select cities and Friday nationwide).

The body count is close to 100. A snively thug, the son of a powerful Russian mobster steals Wick's precious 1969 Mustang and kills his beagle puppy. Vengeance must be Wick's, even if it means extensive collateral damage.

John Wick adds little to the revenge thriller genre, save for a few stylish shots. The first couple times we see a clever camera angle it's mildly impressive. When the same shot is repeated monotonously throughout the film it's one of many irritating aspects of this stupefyingly violent film.

Keanu Reeves plays Wick, a man of few words and many weapons. When we first meet him he's in mourning for his wife (Bridget Moynahan) who died of an unspecified illness.

Upon returning home from her funeral he receives a package. His late wife arranged to have an adorable puppy delivered to her husband posthumously, to keep him company and bring him happiness again.

It's a lovely, thoughtful gesture  the first and last such moment in an overbearingly grim and tedious action film.

Every dog lover will be shaken by the brutal slaying of the innocent pup. Yet it says something about the prevalence of movie violence that the many vicious murders of humans grow numbing.

Conveniently, Wick is a former hit man for the Russian Mob. When he wasn't killing a trio of men with a pencil, he found time to become fluent in Russian. But don't be fooled by Wick's linguistic flourishes. He falls into Bill and Ted's patois soon enough.

Though Wick apparently retired when he found love and domesticity, he kept a stash of automatic weapons and other killing implements under his basement floor  because you just never know when an underworld creep like Iosef (Alfie Allen) might invade your home, steal your ride and kill your dog. Like a twisted Boy Scout, Wick is prepared.

Director Chad Stahelski was the stuntman who replaced Brandon Lee in 1994's The Crow. Here, he assembles a strong cast, then bathes them all in blood. A better script might have counter-balanced the incessant gore.

The ever-nimble Reeves spends much of his time in blood-spattered stylish suits. He checks into a ritzy Manhattan hotel, a mecca for mobsters, and goes on a ruthless slaughterfest, killing his way through a barrage of gangland sleazebags to get to Iosef. Most are shot, often repeatedly and at point-blank range. Some are stabbed viciously or beaten to a pulp. The movie becomes a blur of spurting blood and thudding bodies.

Flashes of twisted humor do arise. The elite gangland hotel offers a couple of wryly amusing moments. Most who checked in could never leave, thanks to Wick. Also funny is the reaction of a police officer who responds to noise complaints at Wick's house. A blood-speckled Wick answers the door with a visible dead body behind him. The cop politely responds: ""I'll let you get back to it.""

And after a dozen dead guys make a bloody mess in his stunning modern manse, Wick phones a company that promptly disposes of corpses and cleans up scattered entrails.

John Wick serves up a noxious, clashing blend of hyper-realistic and cartoonish violence. Too bad there's no cinema decontaminating service that can wash our memories clean of such useless gore.",JDV_Doc10_John_Wick_Review_Negative,Jay Vaidya,Action,Negative,John Wick

     Brief Summary: John Wick is a B-grade action movie about a hitmans quest for (bloody) revenge, but in Reeves nimble hands, it becomes a much more joyous experience. Its a comic book fantasy of how the criminal underworld works, anchored mostly by Reeves raw charisma. As actioner with a solid delivery, style, and even grace, it possesses all the right kind of B-movie pleasures.

After starring in The Matrix (and its two mixed-bag sequels), Keanu Reeves could have done just about anythingincluding becoming Hollywoods next great action star. Instead, he demurred, taking oddball roles in smaller movies, tinkering away on an ultimately illuminating documentary about the sea change happening in film (Side by Side) and directing his own martial arts extravaganza (last years unfairly overlooked Man of Tai Chi). Even an earnest attempt at mainstream studio fare, like 47 Ronin, ends up being far stranger than it has any right to be. The mold was there, he just refused to fit into it. All of this greatly informs the actors decision to star in John Wick. Ostensibly its a B-grade action movie about a hitmans quest for (bloody) revenge, but in Reeves nimble hands, it becomes a much more joyous experience. Its a comic book fantasy of how the criminal underworld works, anchored mostly by Reeves raw charisma.

The storyline here is admittedly rote, and the all-too-familiar narrative begins with the titular John Wick (Reeves) having lost everything: his wife has recently passed away due to some never-specified terminal illness, and the puppy she gave him (as a way to continue living and mourn her passing in a healthy way) is brutally killed by a trio of Russian goons who break into his house (no seriously). Wick has a dark side, we see him angrily hot-rodding around a local airstrip, his face contorted into a Halloween mask of pure rage, unleashed when the one fragment of his former life is taken away. Yes, dramatically, John Wick isnt particularly sophisticated.

Of course, since this is a high-octane action movie and not an existential treatise on the willowy stages of grief, Wick finds himself slipping back into his former life, one in which he was the most ruthless and lethal assassin on the East Coast (one character describes him as the one you sent to kill the fucking boogeyman). This means that his frumpy suburban wear is swapped out for some spiffy dark suits, and he breaks into the cement floor in his basement, revealing a large chest stuffed with murder weapons. Wick then goes about systematically dispatching those responsible for his home invasion, including the son of a big time crime boss he used to work for, a flourish the character chalks up to fate or bad fucking luck.

Totally awash in narrative clich, even for a genre picture, John Wick plays out more or less as youd expect it to, with the character working his way through an ever-growing list of underworld scumbags via splashy, well-choreographed action sequences that dont skimp on the gunplay. Sure, these are bargain basement thrills, but when theyre done with this much aplomb, this much gilded, fetishistic style (rendered in gorgeously anamorphic widescreen), its hard not to get a kick out of all that bloody mayhem. This wont be the most intellectual action movie youll experience this year, especially since its not really worried about upending genre conventions or playing with the form (like, say, The Guest or The Raid 2), but it delivers in a way that few action movies do these days, harkening back to the meat-and-potatoes satisfaction of Reeves own Point Break.

One of the more unexpected aspects of John Wick is the way that it creates a fully realized comic book version of the world of organized crime (seriously, this is closer in tone to Dick Tracy than The Departed). In John Wick, most villainous transactions are paid for via solid gold coins that suggest doubloons from a pirates treasure, when you need a body disposed of you call some unlisted number and ask for a reservation, and an upscale downtown club called The Continental caters specifically to underworld goons. This level of controlled fantasy, which never tips too far into the realm of the surreal or is overdone to the point of obnoxious self-awareness, sets the film apart from other action movies and also allows the violence to take on a level of cathartic cartoonishness. Sure, its grisly and bloody as hell, but it never feels ugly or damaging. Its the characters way of dealing with a very personal pain, and that translates to a much more palpable exploration of similar feelings for any 
given audience. Stripped of its grimness, John Wick actually ends up being more powerful than it otherwise would have been.

Most of the credit for John Wicks success falls squarely on Reeves. As a performer, he has always been underrated, especially when he took on roles that deviated from his suggested path of mainstream heartthrob. Now, even when he plays characters that are closer to those ideals, he still seems to get looked over or ignored (how nobody saw Man of Tai Chi is beyond us). In John Wick, hes able to give the character weight and dimension in ways that ultimately boggle the mind. Even an otherwise laughable moment when Reeves breaks down and cries, mourning the death of his dog but also the passing of his wife, works (OK, maybe theres a few chuckles). Its an emotional beat that you dont expect from a movie that predominantly features a Marilyn Manson song on the soundtrack. But thats what Reeves brings. As an action performer, hes even better than he was in The Matrix films. His movements have become more refined and balletic, his poise graceful and exacting. The way he uses his guns, not just as 
inanimate weapons but as extensions of himself, lends the action some additional retro novelty, since most of the time they feel like something out of the works of John Woo (or his imitators). Bullets fly and dance and detonate flesh, and Reeves is their conductor.

As enjoyable as John Wick is, including some nifty performances by Ian McShane, Adrianne Palicki, Willem Dafoe, and, in a role much more animated than his similarly villainous turn in Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol, Michael Nyqvist, there are instances where it stumbles. The direction, by first-timers David Leitch (who has a background in stunt work) and Chad Stahelski, is occasionally quite slack, and its very clear that they can handle squib-heavy set pieces much better than dialogue-driven scenes. The music, composed by at least three people (including Tyler Bates) is forgettable at its best, and, at its worst, distractingly bad. And for the amount of great performers they were able to cram into a down-and-dirty genre movie like this, you wish that the filmmakers had found more for them to do (is Bridget Moynahan really relegated to dead-wife-in-flashbacks status?).

In the end, there are enough pleasures going on in John Wick to elevate it above just another dumb action movie. With all the talk of world building going on in big studio fare, its impressive that John Wick was able to create a fully realized universe, full of unscrupulous gangsters, inept cops and bloody codes of honor, in a way that few of its big budget counterparts are able to accomplish. That this world is centered around Reeves, though, in a wily performance, makes it all the better. This is the kind of project that could revitalize Reeves, still boyishly handsome even at 50, into an elegant middle-aged action star, in a way that is similar to Liam Neesons recent second wind. Of course, Reeves has been so resistant to being typified in one role or the other that even if John Wick is a huge success, its hard to see him sticking around for subsequent sequels. Reeves has always been restless and maybe thats why his career has been so imprecise and in the wilds post The Matrix. But at least it keeps things interesting. Ultimately, John Wick isnt about to win any awards, or redefine Keanu Reeves career path, or even test your IQ. But as actioner with a solid delivery, style, and even grace, it possesses all the right kind of B-movie pleasures. [B]

     Brief Summary: Keanu Reeves stars as the titular John Wick, the aforementioned hitman whose history has become so legendary in the criminal underworld that his name still elicits shivers and gasps from any thief or murderer who hears it. John Wick employs some of the most creatively brilliant fight choreography you are likely to witness this year.

If you ask anyone who has already witnessed the carnage-in-motion known as John Wick to describe the plot to you in one sentence, be prepared to laugh: A retired hitman abandons his life of solitude to avenge the murder of his beloved puppy. Yep, that's it. While that plot may seem as basic and trite as any film possibly could, I am here to tell you that summary does very little justice to the impending ass-kicking hurricane of a film you are about to endure.

Keanu Reeves stars as the titular John Wick, the aforementioned hitman whose history has become so legendary in the criminal underworld that his name still elicits shivers and gasps from any thief or murderer who hears it, much less utters it. After Wick's wife dies of cancer, the sole reason he retired from 'The Life' to begin with, John retains his quiet existence and takes solace with the last gift his wife bestowed upon him: a puppy. Cue the awwwww.

Well, that awww does not last long as a Russian mobsters moronic son, Iosef (Game of Thrones Alfie Allen), beats Wick to within an inch of his life, kills his dog, and steals his souped-up muscle car for no reason other than overindulgent machismo. When Iosefs father and Wicks former employer, Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), discovers WHO Iosef has done this to, he realizes he must call in every asset he has his disposal for protection. John Wick is coming for his revenge.

Keanu Reeves has never been known as an acting powerhouse, nor has he felt the need to go out of his way to convince you otherwise. He is that rare actor who has had enormous success without demanding to be lauded and applauded. Yet, audiences and critics alike continue to consistently mock the actors ability with nary a concern or scorn from Reeves himself. With all of the acclaim for Speed and The Matrix films, Reeves quietly remains the modest underdog.

Every trailer for John Wick has featured Keanu Reeves angrily shouting the insanely meta line Everyone keeps asking if Im back! Yea, Im thinking Im back! Well, Keanu Reeves never really left. He has kept a lower profile and took a mild break from acting, but if you saw films like 47 Ronin or Man of Tai-Chi, you know that Reeves has remained primed and ready for an action-centric role like this. He just hasnt been getting the press.

How does Reeves use this opportunity to step into the previously worn shoes of Liam Neeson or Jason Statham? He gives one of his most nuanced performances to date and the character of John Wick should now forever be linked to Reeves, just as Neo and Constantine before him. From the opening scenes highlighting a warmer, softer John; to the later scenes where Wick is no more than the great white in Jaws, an unstoppable force-of-nature hell-bent on destroying anyone who had a hand in taking away the very little he had left: Keanu Reeves owns every ounce of John Wick's body and soul.

Reeves also manages to single-handedly keep some of the more cliched or ridiculous aspects of the plot within the realm of reason by the actor's own sheer will. This is Reeves' film and he knows it. It is an even larger testament to Reeves commitment that he is surrounded by top-notch character actors throughout (Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, Adrianne Palicki, John Leguizamo), yet never loses control of the screen each second he barrels through it. The downside to Reeves' resurgence as a marquee action star is that whenever the film parts ways with Wick himself, it grinds to a screeching halt. Films like Taken work because we stay with the hero throughout his mission, rarely stopping to check in and see how our chief villain is doing or for needless exposition from other characters. Once John Wick gets going, it has a few too many scenes revolving around characters discussing how scary Wick is, when all we want is to SEE the man in action. We have already had the build-up so there is no more need to convince us Wick is the devil, this is the time for payoff. None of this derails the movie, but a bit tighter with these scenes could have made this an instant action classic.

Derek Kolstad's script crafts an almost Tarantinoeque-universe, where all worlds are somehow ultimately connected and hyper-violent, yet there remains one last bastion of safety: The Continental Hotel. Any person, wanted or otherwise, can stay at this thug-heavy haven in peace, as the hotel has very specific rules about what kinds of shenanigans are allowed. As basically a criminals version of a Safe Word, The Continental ends up also serving the audience with most of the light-hearted moments in the film. It is a world that could easily be spun off on its own, with Lance Reddicks Hotel Manager serving any assortment of malicious guests. Not a place you want to live, but it sure seems like a fun place to visit every couple of years.

One of the smarter angles this script takes in setting the film up is building Wick to be a criminal boogeyman before we ever seen one ounce of his sadistic tendencies. Even heads of crime syndicates fear his name, sharing stories of the horrific things Wick has done with their henchmen as though they were reading bedtime stories to their children. This is so well done that when Wick finally begins his mission of revenge 30 minutes in, we the audience are already primed and fearful for the destruction and hellfire this man can rain on all involved.

The risk with this sort of build-up is that if the follow-through does not live up to story time, there will be groaning galore from everyone in the audience. Thankfully, directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski realize this and therefore offer up ridiculously exciting set-pieces throughout. They even employ some of the most creatively brilliant fight choreography you are likely to witness this year, so when Keanu Reeves begins his full-on assault of headshots and swivel-kicks so visceral its as if he were dispatching his own critics, there is no doubt Wick is a man deserving to be heralded as legend. John Wick is a fun action spectacle with a pulse-pounding score that is smart enough to cast an actor against type who is committed completely to this abusive insanity. Dont let that simplistic plot description fool you, there is a lot to love in this bullet-riddled action ballet.

Just when John Wick thought he was out, they pull him back in.

Its the tried-and-true formula of one last job/heist/assignment. A longtime bad guy leaves the life of crime in pursuit of peace and quiet, but naturally gets dragged back to his old haunts and habits to settle a final score. But John Wick breathes exhilarating life into this tired premise, thanks to some dazzling action choreography, stylish visuals andmost importantlya vintage anti-hero performance from Keanu Reeves.

Toward the end of the film, a menacing Russian mobster remarks that the veteran hit man John Wick looks very much like the John Wick of old. Keanu Reeves looks very much like the Keanu Reeves of old, as well. Elegantly handsome and athletically lean, he looks fantastic at 50 and is comfortably, securely back in action-star mode. Not that hes been gone that longor deviated that much from his personabut this later-stage butt-kicking does call to mind Liam Neesons recent resurgence in movies like Taken, The Grey and Non-Stop.

After all these years, though, hes still quintessentially Keanu. He radiates a Zen-like calm which makes him simultaneously elusive and irresistible, especially in the face of great mayhem. Theres still a boyish quality to his face but it belies the wisdom of his years. Hes smarter than he looks but hes in no great hurry to go out of his way to prove it to youat least, not onscreen. He just  is.

A character like John Wick is right in Reeves wheelhouse because it allows him to be coolly, almost mythically confident, yet deliver an amusing, deadpan one-liner with detached precision. (This is when traces of the playful characters of his youth  Ted Theodore Logan and Johnny Utahtake a moment to surface.) But when the time comesand it comes often in John Wick  he can deliver with a graceful yet powerful physicality.

Soon after the death of his wife (Bridget Moynahan)  the woman whose love inspired him to retire from his life as an expert assassin  Wick receives an unwelcome visit to his minimalist, modern mansion in the middle of the night. Russian bad guys have come to steal his prized 1969 Mustangand they kill his dog in the process. The latter act is horrifying in itself; whats even worse is that the adorable beagle puppy, Daisy, was a posthumous gift to John from his dying wife, who knew hed need someone else to love.

(Moynahans character, by the way, is barely even a person. Shes an image on a smartphone video clipa body lying in a hospital bed, suffering from an unspecified disease. She's an idea. But her loss provides Wick with a melancholy that lingers over his demeanor and every decision he makes.)

Wick wastes no time unearthing his stashed arsenal and seeking revenge. It turns out that the groups reckless, young leader, Iosef (Alfie Allen), is the son of a former associate of Wicks: mob boss Viggo Tarasov (a sophisticated but scary Michael Nyqvist), who is fully aware of Wicks killing capacity. Also in the mix is Willem Dafoe as an expert sniper who may or may not be on Wicks side. Once the premise is established in the script from Derek Kolstad, its scene after scene of Wick taking out entire rooms full of people who are foolish enough to stand in his way. This is not exactly a complicated genre from a narrative perspective.

But directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitchwho work as a filmmaking team, although Leitch technically takes producing credit  are both veteran stuntmen who clearly know what theyre doing when it comes to this kind of balletic action. Stahelski got his break 20 years ago when he served as a stunt double following Brandon Lees deadly accident while shooting The Crow and went on to perform as Reeves stunt double in The Matrix trilogy. Leitchs work includes doubling for Brad Pitt (in Fight Club and Mr. and Mrs. Smith) and Matt Damon (in The Bourne Ultimatum).

All those years of experience and exposure give their film a level of confidence you dont ordinarily see in first-time directors. Theyre smart enough to let the intricate choreography speak for itself. They let the fight scenes play out without relying on a lot of nauseating shaky-cam or Cuisinart edits, which sadly have become the aesthetic standard of late.

But beyond the exquisite brutality they put on display, theyve also got an eye for artistry, with cinematographer Jonathan Sela helping convey an ominous sense of underworld suspense. Early scenes are so crisply desaturated, they look black and white, from the cloudy, rainy skies over Wicks wifes funeral to his head-to-toe wardrobe to his sleek, slate-gray Mustang. As Wick begins to re-immerse himself in the criminal world hed escaped, other scenes pop in their vibrancythe deep green of a secret, members-only cocktail bar, or the rich red of a Russian bad guys shirt under an impeccably tailored suit.

While the body count grows numbing and repetitive, John Wick actually is more compelling in the aesthetically heightened, specifically detailed world it depicts. Its the New York City of the here and now, but Wick, his fellow assassins and other sundry nefarious sorts occupy their own parallel version of it, with its own peculiar rules which almost seem quaint. They have their own currency: gold coins reminiscent of pirates doubloons, which can be used for goods and services or just as thanks for a favor. And they frequent an upscale, downtown hotel and bar called The Continental (Lance Reddick from The Wire is the unflappably polite manager), a sort of safe zone where protocol dictates that peace prevails, and where killing is cause for dismissal. The courtliness of it all provides an amusing and welcome contrast to the nonstop carnage.

It is a perfect marriage of artist and repertoire. Keanu Reeves, fit, trim and 50, starring in an action-first, story-second movie that years ago would have knocked em dead at the drive-in. John Wick is a slick, propulsive and ridiculous crime picture that strides like an automatic machine gun and has just as much subtlety. But its confidence and elan allow the story to take surrealist turns: more Boormans Point Blank than Bigelows Point Break.

John Wick begins with a cool montage that almost apes the sad Keanu meme. Our leading man, John Wick (who is almost always referred to by his full name  and why not, when its that cool?) is mourning the loss of his spouse in a modern suburban home that looks primed for a photo shoot in Dwell magazine. Before succumbing to disease, his wife organized the delivery of a puppy (cinemas most adorable pet since almighty Uggie) to give him something to love as he tries to heal. When John Wick later runs afoul of some Russian gangsters who want to take his car, he tells them to buzz off in their native tongue. The thugs (led by Game of Thrones Alfie Allen) invade his home late at night, give him a beat down, steal his wheels and kill the pooch. One phone call later John Wick lets everyone know that the demon is out of the bottle.

What Allens bratty-ass punk Iosef didnt realize was that John Wick used to be the top hit-man for his father Viggo (Michael Nyqvist). John Wick had effectively bought himself a right to a peaceful retirement through Herculean levels of mob enforcement, and now that that quiet has been shattered by the whimper of dead doggie, look out!

Veteran stuntmen and second unit directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch, making their debut as feature directors, stage the action with a fierce clarity. John Wick kills his way through neon nightclubs, art deco-inspired hotel rooms and eerily lit churches. Unlike, say, the work of John Woo, there isnt a reliance on slow-motion, which affords the blunt, direct to the head gun-fu  a holy cow, did he just do that? shock value. When you think youve seen John Wick twist in the most acrobatic way to blast the baddie sneaking up behind him, hell strike another pose that tops it.

Of course, a movie about a relentless vengeance machine can only go so far. John Wick ups its game by stopping in for the night at a hotel for contract killers, opening a door into a criminal underworld that in lesser hands would seem silly. (Like, for example, Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguezs recent Sin City: A Dame To Kill For.) In the urban environment of John Wick, an entire service industry of drivers, cleaners and bellman live by night and a code of ethics that, naturally, can be bent for the right price. One of the best things I can say about John Wick is that Id really love to see more movies set in this world, and they dont necessarily have to star these characters. But hopefully from the same directors, as their handle on this milieu feels refreshing and new.

From the use of colour and music to the scenery-chomping by supporting players Willem Dafoe and Ian McShane, these are guys bursting with a love for genre cinema but arent too enslaved by affection to let in a little air. Theres a wonderful free spirit with the use of New York City locations that ditches verisimilitude for storytelling. The Surrogates Courthouse downtown is actually a Bosch-ian dance club with an interior of Scarface-esque hot tubs? Who in their right mind would disagree!

So much recent action cinema feels the need to be gritty, realistic and dark. John Wick is the fun alternative weve been waiting for.",JDV_Doc4_John_Wick_Review_Positive,Jay Vaidya,Action,Positive,John Wick

     Total Word Count: 1061
     Brief Summary: Keanu Reeves serves as just the right star to play Wick, a short-fuse antihero whose ridiculous moniker (borrowed from screenwriter Derek Kolstads grandfather) clumsily conveys his explosive temper. Theres nothing clumsy about the actor who plays Wick, however, as Reeves lithe physicality enables extended sequences in which he moves athletically through an environment full of adversaries.

There are no good guys in John Wick, but there are some great actors working alongside Keanu Reeves in his darkest and most tormented role yet: a stunningly lethal contract killer who goes on a rampage after a Russian thug murders his dog. Yes, his dog. If you can stomach the setup, then the rest is pure revenge-movie gold, as Reeves reminds what a compelling action star he can be, while the guy who served as his stunt double in The Matrix makes a remarkably satisfying directorial debut, delivering a clean, efficient and incredibly assured thriller with serious breakout potential, thanks in part to Summits simultaneous Imax release.

That unsung hero is Chad Stahelski, the stunt guru who stepped into Brandon Lees shoes on The Crow and spent the next two decades absorbing all the behind-the-scenes filming lessons that make John Wick such a technically impeccable actioner. (Stahelski and longtime stunt collaborator David Leitch approached the project as a team, but only Stahelski ultimately received directing credit from the DGA, while Leitch is credited as a producer.) Whereas the tendency among many other helmers is to jostle the camera and cut frenetically in the misguided belief that visual confusion generates excitement, the duo understand what a thrill well-choreographed action can be when were actually able to make out whats happening.

And thats why Reeves serves as just the right star to play Wick, a short-fuse antihero whose ridiculous moniker (borrowed from screenwriter Derek Kolstads grandfather) clumsily conveys his explosive temper. Theres nothing clumsy about the actor who plays Wick, however, as Reeves lithe physicality enables extended sequences in which he moves athletically through an environment full of adversaries, shooting, stabbing or otherwise immobilizing them one at a time.

Since brutally efficient action sequences are in such short supply these days, the fact that John Wick delivers no fewer than half a dozen  home invasion, hotel room, Red Circle club, church parking lot, Brooklyn safehouse, grand finale  more than excuses Kolstads lame-brained script. Basically, the idea is to mislead audiences into believing that Reeves character is a mild-mannered family man, compressing the preceding few months of personal tragedy into a montage in which Wick visits his wife (Bridget Moynahan) in hospital, attends her rain-drenched funeral (where former colleague Marcus, played by Willem Dafoe, makes an ominous appearance), and weeps upon receiving her final gift: a pre-trained puppy named Daisy.

This intro doesnt exactly position Wick as someone Russian mobsters would refer to as the Boogey Man, but of course, everyone in the theater already knows whats coming. Far from fooling anyone, this mopey opening merely provides an awkward bit of melodrama to get past before the carnage can commence  which it does soon enough, when Game of Thrones goon Alfie Allen, playing the bratty son of a Russian crime boss, improbably shows up at a rural gas station and offers to buy Wicks prized 1969 Boss Mustang. When Wick declines, the punk and his friends decide to break into his house and help themselves, beating Wick with baseball bats, smashing his things, snapping the poor dogs neck and taking the Mustang on their way out.

While killing a dog hardly seems enough to justify the meticulously orchestrated mayhem that follows, we should at least be grateful the pic doesnt impose some greater emotional trauma upfront (like forcing us to witness his wifes rape or murder, a la Death Wish). The script waits until this moment, when Iosef takes the stolen Mustang to the shop to have its plates changed, before revealing Wicks reputation. The fence (a tough-looking John Leguizamo) nervously refuses to help, notifying Iosefs relatively civilized mobster dad, Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist, looking suave and collected in the face of certain death), that his son has awakened a monster.

One almost feels sorry for Stahelski, whos been given such a soggy pulp screenplay to work with, and yet its during these B-movie scenes that we start to feel what he can bring to the table. In terms of material, John Wick is nothing special, but theres a suave elegance to the way Stahelski and Leitch approach this thoroughly generic project, seizing the opportunity to deliver some pretty spectacular setpieces along the way.

The result, photographed in sleek, steady-hand widescreen by Vilmos Zsigmond protege Jonathan Sela, looks more like recent Nicolas Winding Refn pics than relatively sloppy studio fare (right down to its cool, neon-lit shootouts), relying on a mix of heavy metal and electronic music from the likes of Marilyn Manson, Tyler Bates and Kaleida to generate propulsive forward energy. Needless to say, Iosef and his thugs picked the wrong guy to mess with. But their mistake wasnt stealing Wicks car and killing his dog. Their mistake was not killing Wick when they had the chance.

As written, everyone seen onscreen is bad to some degree  from the lethal minx (Adrianne Palicki) who accepts a $4 million contract to kill Wick to the corrupt Catholic priest (Munro M. Bonnell) who protects the vault where Viggo stores his valuables  which means every bullet fired potentially stands to make this corrupt underworld a better place. Evidently, evil is relative, and some of these killers are more supportive of Wick than others, including Dafoes Marcus, a fellow sharpshooter who intervenes whenever Wick finds himself in a particularly tight spot, and Ian McShane, who plays the manager of the films most inspired location: a high-end hotel for assassins where the house rules demand that no killing be done on premises.

Clearly, John Wick isnt set in the real world, but rather in the sort of heightened parallel dimension that gamers use for target practice, where they must constantly be on their guard as goons pop up from behind objects and around corners. Thats effectively how we experience the better part of the movie, tagging along as Wick hunts down Iosef and brings down Viggos entire criminal organization in the process. With long greasy hair and wispy facial hair, Reeves isnt nearly as tough or intimidating as your typical revenge-movie antihero, but his star persona helps to make the film more fun  or at least a lot less bleak  than downbeat classics as Rolling Thunder and Get Carter. All that violence wont bring Daisy back, but it helps to clear enough space in Wicks cold-blooded heart for another dog. Maybe hes not so bad after all.",JDV_Doc5_John_Wick_Review_Positive,Jay Vaidya,Action,Positive,John Wick

     Brief Summary: For the most part, John Wick is a silly, ludicrous picture that doesn't really add anything new or reinvent the wheel via the revenge thriller genre. In conclusion, this thing is mildly mediocre.

Liam Neeson has a special set of skills and now it appears that Keanu ""whoa"" Reeves has them too. So OK, picture this: Guy loses wife to illness, guy gets dog as a present from dying wife, guy then gets beautiful Mustang stolen by Russian mobsters who beat said dog to death, guy who was once a professional killer, goes into vengeance mode by offing tons of paperweight Russkie heavies, and finally, guy gets visited by police officer (at his home) who asks him if he's working again, huh? That guy is John Wick of the movie John Wick and he's played by none other than thespian in hiding, Reeves. ""Wick"" clocks in as the fourth revenge/hitman thriller to venture into theaters circa 2014. It lacks the startling epiphany of August's The November Man and the high caliber of acting from a certain Denzel Washington in The Equalizer. However, it's much more focused and assured than the totally discombobulated 3 Days to Kill (the weakest of the four).

For the most part, John Wick is a silly, ludicrous picture that doesn't really add anything new or reinvent the wheel via the revenge thriller genre. Its look is mirrorball glitter and glitz and its style is reminiscent of a Hong Kong action extravaganza (but with less ""Kong"" and tons of ""ganza""). This is a vehicle where Keanu's Wick dispatches so many bad guys you lose count within the first half hour. He does it with some impressive martial arts (much more polished and realistic than what he did in The Matrix) and guns that suggest laser tag, video game artistry, and Men In Black (I wasn't the only critic who picked up on this). As you watch John Wick, you don't condemn it, but you wonder how it didn't somehow land in the straight-to-DVD category. Basically, the whole point with this October release is that the filmmakers throw in scene after scene of non-stop death and destruction. It's to distract you from realizing how generic and tepid it is.

So OK, here are some things I pondered while viewing this bad boy with an undernourished 101 minute running time: 1. why doesn't anybody in this movie bother to wear a bulletproof vest? I mean Wick shoots a lot of his enemies in the chest. This might bring down the body count a little. 2. why does the antagonist (in this case, Viggo Tarasov played by Michael Nyqvist) not shoot the protagonist when he's defenseless and without weapon? You know he's gonna eventually get ya in the end if you let him live. Jeez! 3. do the lives of 50+ people have to end just because a dog died? I mean, I know the dog was Wick's last gift that reminded him of his dead wife but come on! He knew Daisy (dog's name) for one or two sequences, that's it. And yet, just about everyone that wasn't involved in Daisy's passing gets the death incarnate treatment. In general, I can't help but thinking that John Wick is trying to be a parody of your everyday vindictive, revenge fare. When Wick says the Russian gangsters took everything from him, I guess he left out the fact that he still has his beautiful home, expensive, tailor made suits, and plenty of discretionary wealth.

In conclusion, this thing is mildly mediocre but I found the lead role of a former, humblized contract killer to be a nice fit for Keanu Reeves. He's one of those actors that is better off saying the bare minimum of dialogue in order to get through a movie. His job here is to look cool, act cool, and basically exude a brooding screen presence. In his 42nd feature film, he pulls it off with veritable aplomb.

During the second half of John Wick, Keanu's title character says quote unquote, ""people keep asking if I'm back, yeah I'm thinking I'm back."" Not entirely Mr. cool breeze. But nice try though. You're getting there.

Of note: In terms of John Wick's stylistic voyeurism, look for a dance club scene where Reeves gets his kill-on Tom Cruise style (a la 2004's Collateral). Also, look for various subtitles in ""Wick"" that seem akin to the ones used in Tony Scott's Man on Fire (also from 2004). In the realm of casting, be on the lookout for three high profile actors whose roles are underdeveloped (with most of their scenes probably left on the cutting room floor). John Leguizamo plays a chop shop owner, Willem Dafoe plays a fellow hitman and friend of Wick's character, and Bridget Moynahan plays Wick's character's wife. Oh and watch for the goofy guy from the Allstate commercials (Dean Winters, you know Mr. Mayhem) in a small role as the main villain's fruitful lackey.",JDV_Doc6_John_Wick_Review_Negative,Jay Vaidya,Action,Negative,John Wick

     Brief Summary: Co-directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski -- boasting a slick, comic-book noir sensibility -- drag Reeves and their audience through a brisk-ish and brainless 90 minutes of broken limbs, roundhouse kicks and point-blank headshots. It's downfall, however, is its lack of imagination. ""John Wick"" stands as a staggeringly violent and resoundingly dumb collision of Hollywood cliches built around a contrived plot that we've seen countless times before.

If the Keanu Reeves revenge thriller ""John Wick"" has one thing going for it, it's that it has a fairly good sense of what kind of movie it is. This isn't a work of staggering art. It's not a message movie. It's not a film that will change your life. Nor does it want to be.

Rather, it just wants simply to entertain, as co-directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski -- boasting a slick, comic-book noir sensibility -- drag Reeves and their audience through a brisk-ish and brainless 90 minutes of broken limbs, roundhouse kicks and point-blank headshots.

It's downfall, however, is its lack of imagination. ""John Wick"" stands as a staggeringly violent and resoundingly dumb collision of Hollywood cliches built around a contrived plot that we've seen countless times before.

The cliches start at the beginning, with Reeves' lead character (whose name doubles for the film's title, as if we should recognize it). He is a strong but mercifully silent former assassin trying to lead a quiet life of retirement -- you know, like so many assassins do, according to Hollywood. That quiet, however, is shattered as Wick is drawn back into the business -- and by the most glaring contrivances imaginable.

It seems the loose-cannon son (another cliche) of the local Russian mob chieftain (and yet another) has developed a case of the red-hots for Reeves/Wick's vintage Ford Mustang while refueling at a gas station one fine night. What the kid doesn't realize is that Wick is a dangerous man and that his car-coveting ways are only going to set loose a Pandora's box of pain.

He should know better. Not only are Wick and Junior's old man well-acquainted, as it turns out, but so is Wick and just about everybody else circulating in the kid's circle -- including the owner of the chop shop to which he unwittingly brings the car for a good serial-number scrubbing.

That proves oh-so convenient for Wick as he sets out to track down his assailants.

Granted, it's best not to think too much about such storytelling shortcuts in films like this, but they pile up so quickly in ""John Wick"" that they are hard to ignore.

An early scene plays like a ""count the cliches"" filmmaking exercise: A grieving man with a black umbrella stands silently over an open grave as the rain falls steadily. He's being watched by someone at a distance (as indicated by the tree branch in the foreground) and who approaches only after the service is over. It is a grizzled guy named Marcus, and he is played by Willem Dafoe. His reason for stopping by: ""Just checking up on an old friend.""

Permeated by that kind of tired writing, ""John Wick"" is devoid of surprises. You'll know exactly what's going to happen precisely one scene before it actually happens, and for pretty much the entire film.

There are things to appreciate about ""John Wick."" A swanky hotel, which, apparently, caters to assassins, is a great raw storytelling device, serving as a potential launching pad for any number of intriguing stories. And, the hotel manager/concierge played by Lance Reddick (""The Wire,"" ""White House Down"") might be the best character in the film.

That makes Reddick a minority, though, as everyone else is either one-dimensional or needless to the plot. Chief among the latter group: characters played by Clarke Peters (""Treme"") Adrianne Palicki (""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"") and Ian McShane (""Deadwood""). All are talented actors stuck in roles that seem written to pad the film's running time rather than advance its plot.

Still, the whole could have worked if ""John Wick"" had more of a sense of humor about itself. Take Clive Owen's 2007 crime comedy ""Shoot 'Em Up."" That's a film that is, at its root, every bit as violent and underwritten as ""John Wick,"" but which deployed a self-knowing sense of humor to signal that it was, indeed, in on the joke.

For its part, ""John Wick"" makes a few feeble attempts at witty repartee, but, in the end, Leitch and Stahelski's film feels like an unintentional parody of itself.",JDV_Doc7_John_Wick_Review_Negative,Jay Vaidya,Action,Negative,John Wick

     Brief Summary: With any luck, you'll be carried out of consciousness well before the film's lean-on-paper 96 minutes run their course. Leaden, preposterous and short on even the wrong kind of laughs, there's a new name in plain, crummy action cinema: Wick. John Wick.

New drinking game: Drink every time a character in the movie John Wick says the words ""John Wick."" With any luck, you'll be carried out of consciousness well before the film's lean-on-paper 96 minutes run their course.

Starring Keanu Reeves as a retired hitman getting back into the game to settle a score  a plot setup that an iPhone could probably auto-complete after the words ""a retired hitman ""  John Wick is the most blatant attempt to establish a character's name recognition since the Angelina Jolie actioneer Salt.

It feels like every sixth line of dialogue breaking up the string of bloody, close-quarters brawls and murky, boring shootouts contains, or is entirely constituted by, the words ""John Wick."" Reeves even says ""Wick, John Wick"" like he's copping Bond. It's a surprising show of restraint that the film's credits don't come fitted with a knock-off version of the Shaft theme, supplied with chorus responses of ""Wick!""

Yes, John Wick's a not-so-complicated man whom no one understands but his woman (Bridget Moynahan). Then that woman dies of cancer, leaving our grieving contract killer with nothing but memories of life more ordinary. And an adorable puppy. Then that puppy is killed by Russian gangsters. They also steal John Wick's car, a cherry-condition '69 Mustang.

Speaking against music-censorship legislation in 1984, infamous kook-rocker Frank Zappa commented that in their severity, the proposed laws were the equivalent of ""treating dandruff by decapitation."" The same can be said of John Wick's tack on this-time-it's-personal retribution. A dead puppy and stolen car are met with biblical vengeance, as Wick tears through New York, indiscriminately murdering anyone who is a Slavic criminal or who may unfortunately find themselves standing between a Slavic criminal and John Wick.

Wick's target is a sneering heir to a mob empire, played by Alfie Allen, Game of Thrones's Theon Greyjoy. Again, Allen plays a violently impulsive disappointment to a glowering father (Michael Nyqvist). But then, nobody in John Wick is cast against type. There's Deadwood's Ian McShane as a garrulous hotelier, Oz's Dean Winters as Nyqvist's sleazeball man-at-hand and The Wire's Clarke Peters as a stern and dignified presence amid the shoot-'em-up mayhem, to single out just a few members of the film's packed stable of ""hey it's that guy!"" C-listers.

Then there's Reeves, whose spiky, middle-parted bangs make him look like an early draft of a character from a Final Fantasy video game and whose characteristically affectless ""duh, duh"" delivery make John Wick feel like a gloomier, grislier riff on Dude, Where's My Car?

Directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski distinguished themselves as Hollywood stuntmen, and their experience shows. This is a film where every human being is a sack of meat waiting to be tenderized. Not even the wide-eyed puppy dogs are safe.

Worse is Derek Kolstad's screenplay, which touches on every revenge-movie cliche like he cranked it out overnight to net a barely passable D-plus in a night-school screenwriting class. The great revenge movies  the original Death Wish, the first Taken movie  work because the stakes are intensely personal. The setup in John Wick just feels like sloppy narrative longhand for someone flipping a switch to turn a reformed killer back into a plain old killer.

The film also seriously courts a ludicrous idea that there's a whole not-so-secret subculture of contract killers, with their own bars where they trade in their own literal currency. John Wick's particular set of skills barely registers as exceptional, let alone thrilling, in a world where everyone else is comparably equipped.

     Brief Summary: Keanu Reeves, the fading 50-year-old star is going to have to do better than John Wick if he wants to compete with Liam Neeson and Denzel Washington as a senior star of revenge shoot-em-ups. The slaughter in John Wick quickly grows monotonous.

Keanu Reeves is now eligible for AARP membership, but the fading 50-year-old star (anybody see his $175 million flop 47 Ronin last Christmas?) is going to have to do better than John Wick if he wants to compete with Liam Neeson and Denzel Washington as a senior star of revenge shoot-em-ups. Reeves' performance in his lastest flick does little to enhance the lackluster production and is a far cry from the heyday of his acting career.

Certainly theres no shortage of spurting blood once his retired hit man sets out to wipe out the Russian mafia in New York City  after one of their more cretinous young members (Alfie Allen) kills the dog left as a posthumous gift by his wife (Bridget Moynahan) when John declines to sell the punk his beloved 1969 Mustang.

As the victims of Johns grief therapy reach into the triple digits, you have to agree with his former boss in the Russian mob, Viggo (Michael Nyqvist of the Swedish The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo)  who just happens to be the punks dad. He pleads with John, No more guns! No more bullets!

No such luck. Washington, who eliminated the Russian mafia in Boston in the recent and far superior The Equalizer, at least varied the mayhem with all sorts of novel hand-to-hand combat.

Aside from the very occasional stab with a dagger, John prefers to shoot people at point-blank range. It gets old fast. Lacking in imagination and charater development, the movie stagnated.

Reeves tries scrunching up his face in anguish every now and then, but essentially remains the same somnolent performer as in The Matrix 15 years ago  only Derek Kolstad has provided him with a vastly less clever script, one that mistakes jokiness for wit.

Although it is funny when  after dispatching a dozen hit men sent to his home by Viggo  the cop who stops by Johns home in New Jersey to investigate a noise complaint by neighbors merely asks, You been working again? Ill leave it to you again, before John (whose nickname is the boogeyman) calmly calls in a corpse-removal service.

This also makes no sense in a film that also asks to be taken seriously  even though John follows his escape from an ambitious assassination attempt by checking into a Manhattan boutique hotel for criminals run by Winston (Ian McShane), where the services include an in-house surgeon.

Then again, this is the kind of film in which the cops dont even show up when John blows up a vault in a church after dispatching a dozen people.

Other actors with paper-thin roles include Willem Dafoe as a criminal friend of Johns who accepts a $3 million commission to rub him out, Adrianne Palicki as a lethal bartender, Lance Reddick as the hotels campy, all-too-accommodating concierge, and John Leguizamo as a hot-car specialist.

Debuting co-director Chad Stahelski (Reeves stuntman on The Matrix) has clearly studied the films of John Woo, but the slaughter in John Wick quickly grows monotonous.

The Conjuring spawned the Annabelle franchise and then The Conjuring 2 saw the series go into full MCU mode, including several different baddies intended for future spin-offs (although so far we've only had The Nun). We've even had a surprise Conjuring universe movie in The Curse of La Llorona, thanks to an unexpected crossover character.
It's easy to forget that the basis of the series was in the real-life experiences of demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren. The third movie in the 'main' series, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, however, takes it back to basics  and it proves to be a terrifying fresh direction.
Gone (mostly) are the nods to previous movies and any set-up for future ones, with the movie solely focusing on the darkest case of the Warrens' career: the trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson.
Back in 1981, Johnson killed his landlord and when it came to the trial, he claimed demonic possession as a defence to his actions. It was believed the demon came from a previous exorcism of David Glatzel, the younger brother of Johnson's girlfriend Debbie, where both he and the Warrens were in attendance.
The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It's intense opening will terrify you whether you believe in demons or not. It centres on the exorcism of David Glatzel and sees director Michael Chaves unashamedly lean into The Exorcist, right down to the arrival of the priest, and it'll satisfy any horror fan.
With some impressive practical effects, it's a breathless start and hints that this isn't a typical Conjuring movie as the Warrens don't succeed. The effects of that failure see Johnson (played by Ruairi O'Connor) plagued by the same demon that had a hold on David Glatzel, eventually leading to Johnson fatally stabbing his landlord.
It's here when the Warrens got back involved (both in real life and in the movie), but The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It doesn't become a courtroom drama. In real life, the defence was thrown out fairly quickly, which doesn't leave much of a movie. Chaves and writer David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick instead turn the movie into CSI: Conjuring as the Warrens investigate the apparent possession of Johnson.
As in the previous Conjuring movies, the plot sets up the scares and also delves into the relationship between Ed and Lorraine Warren. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are terrific, unsurprisingly, and it's pleasing that the third movie sees Farmiga take on a more central role. If it's not quite a ""love story"" as Farmiga says, there are still some sweet moments between the two that add to the heightened emotion of the finale.
What's impressive is that we know both of them are going to be OK, yet their committed performances mean we're always nervous. Chaves puts them in some brilliantly-crafted set pieces, including an unforgettable morgue sequence, that test the pair to their limits and they never fail. Horror performances aren't recognised enough, and Wilson and Farmiga deserve every plaudit going.
While their investigation is mostly fictional, it does show some fascinating insight into how the Warrens started to work more with police on these kinds of cases. It brings a new angle to the series as we're not seeing the Warrens investigate a haunting house as it happens, while Chaves also adds moments of levity that we're just not used to seeing in this series.
Chaves is clearly a horror fan too and doesn't forget to keep the scares coming at a regular pace, even when Lorraine Warren is busy being a paranormal detective. There are nods to several horror classics and rather than feeling like a rip-off, they feel like a loving homage and add an extra level to the set pieces that will leave you peering into every shadow.
If you're being especially critical, you might also take umbrage with the movie using a real-life case of murder as the jumping point for a fictional horror tale, one that has no nuance in terms of what happened to Johnson. This movie, as the others have in the series, treats demons as very real, because that's how the Warrens viewed it and the Conjuring series is their story.
That's unlikely to bother fans of the series though as it's what they expect, although The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It still brings them something new too. You might not believe that the devil made him do it, but you will be terrified.

Dont worry, there's no way for you to miss that utterly pronounced scene, especially if you've watchedaDavid Finchermovie or two. There is a creaky basement. A creepy old man leads the way to it. He might be the Zodiac killer (okay, not exactly, but something along those lines), and yet, someone who barely knows him follows him down all the same, just to gather some evidence around a series of murders.Had that point never arrived, I could have more easily dismissed the third The Conjuring installmenta straight sequel chapter after a number of spin-offs like Annabelle and The Nun with varying degrees of smarts, skill and scaresas a horror movie that cant be bothered to live up to its breathtaking origins. Again, this outing manages to operate as a mediocre police thriller to some degree; but one with too many suspects and incidents-within-harrowing incidents. A mysterious serial murder case emerges amid the films confusing tone and someone obsessed enough with its puzzling details has to voluntarily go down the rabbit hole in order to crack it.But who the hell actually wants the new The Conjuring to be downgraded to a mere whodunit anyway, when its original predecessor is still one of the most brilliant and frightening horror movies of the 21stcentury? If youre not that person, this films array of hollow jump-scares and uninteresting secrets that culminate in short-lived thrills is unlikely to impress you, despite some successful effects and elegant camerawork by cinematographerMichael Burgess. Still, The Curse of La Llorona filmmaker Chaves gives it a shot, directingPatrick WilsonandVera Farmigaas they once again portray paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren wrapped up in a based-on-a-true-story case. The prologue here takes place in 1981, when the exorcism of the adolescent David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard) leaves Arne Johnson, a good-spirited young man in a loving relationship with Davids sister Debbie (Sarah Catherine Hook), haunted by the grip of an evil force. When Arne commits a horrific murder in the aftermath of the events that use one too many recognizable visual nods to The Exorcist (including a laughably obvious shot of a priest standing by a soft street lamp with a suitcase in hand), the Warrens slowly uncover similar crimes that took place in the area. So they embark on a quest to prove to Arnes apprehensive lawyer that Arne wass actually possessed while committing the crime. (His real-life case apparently marks the first time in the US where demonic possession was used as defense in a court case.)ScreenwriterDavid Leslie Johnson-McGoldrickthrows in plenty of The Conjuring universe references into his script, including an inspired joke with Ed suggesting to introduce Arnes skeptical lawyer to the cursed doll Annabelle to clear a few of her questions up. But ultimately, the story struggles in the hands of a strange on-and-off rhythm that almost feels episodic as the Warrens team up with the local police, knock on doors, venture out into the forest, crawl around basements, and collaborate with customary religious figures to follow the devils tracks. The basic idea gets overstuffed and overstretched, ultimately losing its clutch on the audience, especially when the plot ventures out to another similar murder case between two girlfriends and distances itself from the main event for long and dull stretches of time. So much that when Ed and Lorraine come to understand the witchcraft-y nature of their case, you might run out of reasons to care for their mission, or worse, forget what they were out there chasing to begin with. Things dont improve much even afterEugenie Bondurants chillingly witchy Occultist shows up.There is no denying that Wilson and Farmiga have come to portray two of the most iconic figures of contemporary horror. That familiarity, down to the Warrens customary sculpted hairdos and old-fashioned, thoughtfully costume-designed clothes, is both comforting and transfixingwe somehow came to want to spend time with this duo and perhaps even to feel safe in their presence. But our goodwill and sense of nostalgia for the Warrens goes only so far in this third film. One almost wishes Chaves and Johnson-McGoldrick had not tried to reinvent the wheel, and instead just stuck with the franchises sophisticated simplicity and tried-and-true paranormal formula. Without a focal haunted house, this one just doesnt feel like a film that belongs in The Conjuring universe.",JM_Doc1_The_Conjuring_3_Negetive,Jeffrey Mao,Horror,Negative,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

All hell breaks loose early and often in The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It. A creepy old Connecticut house shudders in the grip of demonic forces that shred the wallpaper (an improvement, honestly) and tear at the body and soul of an 11-year-old boy, triggering acrobatic contortions so violent they make Linda Blairs head spins look like hot yoga. If The Exorcist seems by now too obvious a point of reference, its one this movie nonetheless invokes, first when an old priest arrives on this misty night and later when a heroic young man dares the devil to abandon the poor boy and take him instead.
The devil gladly complies, vacating the body of young David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard) and seizing hold of his older sisters boyfriend, Arne Cheyenne Johnson (Ruairi OConnor). But Arne, rather than hurling himself to his death, lives on, now hosting a demonic parasite that takes its not-so-sweet time making itself known. Jump scares galore ensue, blowing your eardrums and filling the screen with jack-in-the-box apparitions and hallucinatory washes of red. By the time Arne is arrested for the brutal murder of his landlord (Ronnie Gene Blevins), the movie has already laid out its case, aptly summed up by the title.
Proving it in a court of law will be a trickier matter, one that naturally falls to Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), that God-fearing, ghost-busting duo who have given these movies their romantic pulse and spiritual oomph. In this latest movie, directed by Michael Chaves from a script by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, they set out to prove that Arne is not guilty by reason of demonic possession  a tricky task that will bring them into contact with all manner of fellow true believers and professional skeptics. (The fine ensemble cast includes Keith Arthur Bolden, Ashley LeConte Campbell, Eugenie Bondurant and especially John Noble as a delectably strange priest turned paranormal expert.)
Like its superior predecessors, The Conjuring (2013) and The Conjuring 2 (2016), The Devil Made Me Do It was ripped from one of the Warrens real-life case files, this one centered on a 1981 murder trial that they successfully  and none too scrupulously  turned into a cause clbre. Whether you regard the Warrens as righteous spiritual warriors, wily hucksters or both, their self-promotional acumen has never been in doubt, as the mere existence of these movies amply demonstrates. (Ed Warren died in 2006; Lorraine Warren, who served as a consultant on the series, died in 2019.)
As a rule, the words based on a true story should trigger any viewers skepticism; thats even more the case when a movie is as straight-faced in its presentation of supernatural events as these are. Not that you had to believe a second of the first two Conjuring movies  both directed with pulse-quickening intensity by James Wan (whos credited as a producer here)  to find them wildly entertaining, especially since stories about possessions and hauntings are predicated on a shivery suspension of disbelief to begin with. If the illusion is slower to take hold in The Devil Made Me Do It, its because of the heightened moral stakes  the question of a mans guilt or innocence in the matter of a monstrous crime  as well as the movies more workmanlike approach to shocks and scares.
Chaves made his feature debut with The Curse of La Llorona (2019), one of several feature-length offshoots, like The Nun and the Annabelle movies, in the increasingly tangled Conjuring franchise. (I think were supposed to call it a universe, but some directives, like the devil himself, should be resisted.) Chaves is a solid craftsman with a weakness for easy jolts, but also a gift for filling the frame with strategically unnerving pools of light and shadow; he can turn even a daylit room into something ominous and suggestive. He also orchestrates a memorable flashback to young Davids first encounter with evil, a scene that will make you grateful that waterbeds went the way of the dodo.

When going into any of The Conjuring movies, you first have to make some major concessions. You first have to accept that these are highly fictionalized versions of Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga). The real Warrens were allegedly scumbags. You have to believe that the supernatural stuff theyre fighting is totally real and that any skepticism will be obliterated even though that raises tricky questions about those who would fake supernatural abilities or argue for the existence of demons. You basically have to embrace The Conjuring movies as a ride, and youre happy to go along with this loving couple who fights evil to restore domestic bliss to those they meet. But by the time youve come to The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, theres not much life left in this franchise between the Warrens love and devotion to each other. And yet even here, you have a film that constantly refuses to question any of its tenets, so it simply feels like another episode of a series rather than a sequel that builds or expands The Conjuring universe is any way. For those looking for the brand of horror these movies provide, theyll probably be sated, but you cant shake the feeling that this franchise has become too staid to be scary.
In 1981, Ed and Lorraine are overseeing an exorcism of a little boy, David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard). Arne Johnson (Ruairi OConnor) is the boyfriend of Davids older sister Debbie (Sarah Catherine Hook) and wants to protect young David, so during the exorcism, he demands that the demon take him instead, and the demon obliges Arne. Ed witnesses the transference but suffers a heart attack and loses consciousness before he can tell anyone whats happened. Arne, for some reason, also tells no one of this transference, which becomes a problem when he ends up stabbing Debbies boss to death. With Ed recovering from his heart attack, the Warrens set out to prove that Arne was under a demonic possession at the time of the murder, but its a race against time as theres a Satanist out to destroy not only Arne but Ed as well.
The strong core of these movies is and remains the relationship between Ed and Lorraine. Not only do Wilson and Farmiga have excellent chemistry together, but its ultimately the argument for everything they do. The Warrens, through the strength of their marriage, represent a domestic tranquility that they seek to restore wherever they go. The random evil coming for a family can be picked out of a hat (the villain for The Conjuring 2 was changed in post-production to give you a sense of how little the specifics of the antagonist mean to these movies), but its up to the Warrens and their inherent, unquestionable goodness, that comes to restore peace to families. In the case of Arne Johnson, he both mirrors the Warrens in his love for Debbie as well as risking his personal safety to protect a family when he takes the demon from David. The Devil Made Me Do It seeks to test the marriage of the Warrens, but as always, these tests are external and demonic rather than internal and complicated.
Obviously, theres a fun escapism at work here thats contributed to the franchises success. Its comforting to believe that theres an external evil that can be defeated if you simply know the right way to do it, and that you can depend on morally uncompromised characters like the Warrens to save the day. But the simplicity of the text shows that the series is basically running on fumes. Sure, you can keep spinning off new monster movies like Annabelle and The Nun, but the core story about the Warrens doesnt have anywhere to go because The Devil Made Me Do It shows the filmmakers have clearly settled into a formula whether its James Wan, or in the case of The Devil Made Me Do It, Michael Chaves at the helm. And theres certainly something to be said about horror cinema thats also oddly comforting, and The Conjuring series manages to slide right into that odd niche.
But at some point, we expect horror to elicit some kind of fear or anxiety, and The Devil Made Me Do It studiously avoids any deeper conflict than having the Warrens fight some new kind of evil. For instance, the films 1981 setting coincides with the Satanic Panic, and yet The Devil Made Me Do Its world argues that Satanists are very real and very here to ruin your life. How does this story fit into a framework that argues for an evil that, in reality, came from paranoia and moral panic? The Conjuring movies rarely question the validity of any claim. Ed and Lorraine have their beliefs, but their beliefs always tend to reinforce the investigation, so its like two Fox Mulders on the case and sometimes you really need a Dana Scully to hold the dramatic tension. Instead, The Conjuring movies always work from a premise that supernatural evil is real and must be combatted. This evil typically manifests as something that jumps out and makes a loud noise.
Weve seen that story twice already and hinting at a court case in The Devil Made Me Do It is pretty much a dead end since we never really see any trial here. This is a new case to solve with the trial of Arne Johnson providing a framework rather than a plotline. Its the reason to send the Warrens off on a new investigation rather than trying to make the argument that what they do is admissible in a court of law. Of course, putting the Warrens beliefs on trial would in effect be putting them on trial, and that brings us back to the central problem that these movies simply do not want to challenge their heroes with anything that isnt supernatural.
What makes The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It so bewildering is that it offers up fresh avenues to take the series and challenge both the characters and the audiences, and it simply opts for more of the same even with a new director. The filmmakers have settled on This is what a Conjuring movie is, and while that may be comforting for fans and profitable for the studio, its not horrifying or thoughtful in any meaningful way.

That does it. Ive officially lost faith in The Conjuring Universe.
In 2013, Saw helmer James Wan brought a renewed prestige to haunted house horror by casting critically adored actors Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as the Lorraine and Ed Warren, a married couple known for battling the paranormal with the power of their Catholic faith. The runaway success of The Conjuring spurred not only a solidly scary sequel (The Conjuring 2), which stayed true to the family-focused haunted house roots, but also branches of spinoffs: The Curse of La Llorona, The Nun, and the Annabelle franchise. To put it mildly, none of these have bested the original for filmmaking or acclaim. And now, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It has arrived to show its time to let this tree of terror die at the root.
Set in 1981, this third installment has the Warrens facing down a mysterious demon, who begins by plaguing a bespectacled 8-year-old boy, then moves onto a hardworking, clean-cut young white man. Obviously, that is why Arne Johnson (Ruairi OConnor) fatally stabbed his landlord 22 times. Because its impossible to imagine such a nice white man would commit such egregious violence without the devil being involved.
When an exorcism goes sideways, the Warrens feel responsible for Arnes legal troubles, which could land him a death sentence. So, they find a lawyer, convince her off-camera that supernatural is real, then push the defendant to plead not guilty for reason of demonic possession.
Of course, the lawyer initially bristles at the idea of invoking Satan-related testimony in a court of law. But Ed Warren argues with a surly sureness, The courts recognize the existence of God every time a witness swears to tell the truth. I think its about time they accept the existence of the Devil.
It seems The Conjuring 3 is gearing up for a potentially landmark courtroom battle, which might crackle with the Warrens testimony, rich with creepy flashbacks. As they aim to prove to a jury the devil is real, it might have been like a clip show for episodes of paranormal events we never saw before! Nope. Instead, Arnes trial is used as the loose based on real events hook, while the Warrens chase down spooky totems, a malevolent curse, and a mysterious demon. This might sound promising, but I assure you the ultimate villain is deeply disappointing: (sing it with me) IT WAS SATANISTS ALL ALONG!
As the title teases, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It leans hard into the Satanic Panic of the 1980s, but with zero recognization that it was a moral panic that was overwhelmingly made up of hype and lies. Instead, they build a Satanist straw man, who looks like she could be Lorraines evil twin. Played by Eugenie Bondurant, this Satanist is a thin, painfully pale white woman with angular features, a prim bun, and a modestly cut but dourly black dress. This bland Big Bad must be hunted down before she leads more nice white Christian men to vicious acts they would never commit on their own. To a very specific audience, this might be deeply scary. Not to me though.
Maybe its because Im a lapsed Catholic. The threat of demons no longer rattles my knees; Ive seen the good men of faith that I grew up around outed as abusers again and again. Maybe its because Im aware that the Satanic Panic of the 80s was a hysteria sparked by false allegations and outrageous memoirs, which were later debunked. Maybe its because I turned up for a ghost story and eye-rolled the moment Ed started stumping for more Christian influence in government. Maybe for all of the above, I have no patience for the bad faith argument made by screenwriter David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and director Michael Chaves.
This franchise was founded by Wan and screenwriters Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes. Theyve handed off the reigns, and The Conjuring has gone off the rails, moving from low-key Conservative vibes (religious heroes, messages of family unity and faith) to a full-on attack on a separation between church and state. In the movie, stern characters declare that Satanists are merciless monsters, who do blood sacrifices and commit horrid rituals to create chaos and pain. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It wont even give a motive to its evil Satanist. Theres no humanizing her, only literally demonizing her. The Big Bad is a curse-placing hell bitch just because, okay?
In real life, modern Satanists are often activists, who organize to combat religious groups trying to get special treatment under the law. So, yeah the Warrens wouldnt be fans. (For more on that, check out documentaries like Hail Satan or even I, Pastafari: A Flying Spaghetti Monster Story.) However, also in real-life, unfounded stories of blood ritual-making, child-abducting Satanists spur conspiracy theories that create dangerous political movements. So, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do Its Satanist plot is not just a disappointing horror route to take, its one meant to appeal to the fears of a very vocal and fanatical group. As if they need the encouragement.
Of course, horror movies have long had conservative bends. The slashers of the 80s connected sex and death, reflecting the hysteria over casual sex and the AIDS crisis. The idea the being a good girl could help you survive ran deep. This is why its supposed to be so frightening that Arne, who is kind to the little possessed boy and dreams of marrying his doll-faced girlfriend and likes dogs, can be turned into a tool of evil. To watch him suffer the consequences of a demons actions is to imagine ourselves overtaken by evil unawares. This is the kind of terrifying tendril that conspiracy theorists offer the well-meaning but gullible: just beneath the surface of the banalsay a pizza shop or a waterbed from Wayfair)evil lurks, and its up to us to fight it at every turn! Then, we too could be heroes, like the Warrens.
Politically, I loathe this movie for its pandering and reckless hyping of a moral panic that is alive and all-too-well. As a horror fan, I hate this movie for being so damn dull.
Wans skill for scares is rightfully heralded. Chaves doesnt have his chops. A prolonged exorcism sequence involves violence, a shower of blood, a creepy kid, and some rancid ripoffs of The Excorcist, like the requisite shot of a silhouetted priest and Regans creepy contortions pushed into Uncanny Valley by egregious CGI. There will be ghouls, who seem snatched from the Japanese terror tradition of pail, black-veined, long hair, bug-eyes. Creatures will be eerily still, then break into a ramped run. There will be misdirects and jump scares. But not a single thing will be anywhere near as satisfyingly scary as the clapping hands sequence in The Conjuring. All these years later, I still get chills thinking about that one.
In between underwhelming scare setpieces, the Warrens talk. A lot. They talk in lawyers chambers. They talk in police stations. They talk in cars and forests and a morgue. A lot of that talk is Ed asking leading questions of Lorraines visions as if itd never occur to her to explain the things she sees to other people. Its tedious, and despite their undeniable gravitas, Farmiga and Wilson are mired in within it. Whether talking about paranormal threats, Ed and Lorraines great love story, or the power of faith, they seem to be going through the motions, as if tromping through a matinee show for a near-empty theater.
The thrill is gone. The fun has died. The point is blunted and yet more dangerous. So, dont be tempted by The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It.

The Conjuring Cinematic Universe continues this week with its latest entry, another sequel in the series proper. This is the first film in that series to have a subtitle (The Devil Made Me Do It). But youre going to have read our review of The Conjuring 3 to see what we really thought about it.
As I mentioned in my post on the Conjuring 3 trailer, this movie, like its predecessors, is based on a true story. And like its predecessors, its VERY loosely based on the facts. Because if theres one thing this film series loves to do, its take a case from the Warrens archives and But like, what if it were real? it.
Anyway, as I said in that post, this film is based on the case of Arne Johnson (Ruairi OConnor). The 19-year-old, who lived with his fiance, Debbie Glatzel (Sarah Catherine Hook), stabbed their landlord to death in 1981. The film doesnt stray from this, the most basic and provable facts about the case. It also sticks pretty close to the story when it comes to the Warrens involvement. (Again, as I wrote, the Warrens had been involved in exorcisms of Debbies 11-year-old brother, David (Julian Hilliard), who was absolutely overflowing with demons. Allegedly.)
Where it starts to drift, though, is in its explanation of Arnes motive. Yes, as in real life, the Warrens try for a devil made me do it defense. But unlike in real life, there turns out to be a bit more to everything than just a simple, random (alleged) possession.
That, of course, has been baked into the Conjuring Cinematic Universe since the first movie. There was something behind all that haunting in The Conjuring, for instance. It was a witch. And in The Conjuring 2, it wasrag lung? (Sorry, I might be getting that confused with the Last Podcast episode on the same source material.)
Anyway, thats always been one of the less necessary elements of the franchise to me. In other words, I dont really care whats doing it; I just want to see some spooky scaries and the capable vibes of the movie Warrens. (The real life Warrens, on the other hand, were a lot different.)
So if thats what youre into, then youll find The Conjuring 3 to be a decent, if never that thrilling addition to the CCU. Its a solid movie, a Conjuring movie, just like the previous films in the series. But I couldnt help but feel as if it werent up to the last ones, as if something were missing.
Part of that has to do with the subject matter. Theres a haunted place, yes, but its not really the focus. Arne and his crime are, and they just arent that compelling enough to carry the movie. There are a few bright spotsthe exorcism of David Glatzel, for instance, that opens the movie is genuinely disturbing. And so is the sequence that leads up to the murder. But again, these arent enough to make the movie scary or successful enough as a whole.
However, if theres another part to the Conjuring formula besides the mostly ghostly, then its the Warrens themselves. More specifically, its the Warrens love story. At this point, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga obviously know these characters, so they make the story as charming as it could be. Or, again, more specifically, they make that part of the story endearing.
But theyre not the only part, of course. The bigger part is what drove Arne to kill his landlord, and that ends up devolving into a Satanic Panic-influenced plotline that just feels dated. Its also strange that we hear so little from Debbie, especially since shes there when the murder happens. How did she see it? What did she think? The movie doesnt seem to be interested in her perspective, because its more intent on getting to the real cause.
Nice Exorcist reference, though (image via Warner Bros Pictures)
When it gets there, though, it feels pointless. Im not a fan of possession narratives in general, because I dont see the scare. Unfortunately, this movie didnt make enough of a case to convince me. Maybe youll have better luck.

With neither flying furniture nor a residential incantation, evil takes on a more tangible form this time. Its also the first film in the trilogy, featuring Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as real-life demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren, not directed by series mastermind James Wan. At the helm this time is Michael Chaves, who previously directed the deservedly maligned The Curse of La Llorona, another installment of the Conjuring saga. Chaves gets a far superior showcase for his filmmaking abilities in the genre, from the screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (The Conjuring 2) to Wilson and Farmigas lived-in charm and gravitas as their religiously passionate characters.  
Offering several nods to The Exorcist, The Devil Made Me Do It opens with a disturbing sequence, set in 1981, that stands as the scariest part of the supernatural saga to date. Thats not to say that the nearly two hours that ensue are devoid of tension and well-paced jump scares, but the sheer chaos and malevolence on display right out of the gate are unmatched elsewhere.

That violent showdown between the Warrens and a demonic power introduces young David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard, WandaVision), a victim of possession, and Arne Johnson (Ruairi OConnor, The Spanish Princess), who is dating Davids sister. Desperate to save the child, Arne invites the inhuman spirit to take over his body instead. A few days later, under its sinister influence, the hard-working young man murders his landlord and must convince a jury that, in fact, the devil made him do it.
Whats most interesting about this new spiritual battle is that the Warrens are confronted with a human villain with similar aptitudes as theirs (but harnessed for the occult) as opposed to free-flowing energies from hell. Farmiga devours the role once again with a mix of fragility and determination. Her concern for Wilsons Ed, amplified when a totem appears in their home, contrasts with the toll that we know each assignment takes on Lorraine. Theres no reinvention to the characters, but a solid reprisal.
Additionally, the duo face the skeptical world at large to provide irrefutable proof needed to save Arne from a death sentence; even if this is the motivation for the Warrens to investigate the events, the plot never focuses on the courtroom. The scares in dark spaces and Lorraines tenebrous visions continue to take precedence.
The visual grammar and specific world-building that Wan devised for the two earlier films  the text over a freeze frame to set up the chapter, for instance, or a visit to the room where the Warrens keep all their haunted trinkets  is fully respected. Chaves seems not to deviate far from what was already in place, and thats a smart move. The prolonged long takes that toy with our expectations and lead up to the big frights remain effectively calibrated.
The franchise is at its scariest when it doesnt rely heavily on the CGI creatures and instead on the inherent eeriness of the darkness and what it hides. In The Conjuring 2, the longer and closer we stare at the computerized Crooked Man and The Nun, the less terrifying they become. Showing, rather than suggesting, has been a problem over the last decade or so in many big-studio horror movies.
In The Devil Made Me Do It, thankfully, the most shocking scenes demonstrate the grotesque effects of the curse at play on the human body. Arnes body contorting in the air is far more nightmare-inducing than a pristine digital monster.
Neither this film nor The Conjuring 2 manage to surpass the original in surprise value, but each new release reminds us that the distinctive success of The Conjuring universe as a whole derives from some key machinations built into its very concept. All of these movies are period pieces, which protects the narratives from the scrutiny of modern technology. None are gratuitous in their gruesomeness but instead anchor their stakes on a strong emotional bond, like that between a mother and her children. And they uphold the notion that if theres a God, then there must be an equal and opposite force for evil. That last part is never in question. These are not the types of stories that bargain in ambiguity.

97,JM_Doc7_The_Conjuring_3_positive,"Title: The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do it      Authors: Richard Serrano Denis     Source/Date: comicsbeat June 08, 2021     URL: https://www.comicsbeat.com/review-the-conjuring-3/     Total Word Count: 830 wordsA detail thats often overlooked about the main Conjuring movies is the fact that each one of them is supposed to be based on true events. The second entry, for instance, gave audiences two real-life hauntings that arent only well-documented but also inspired fictionalized accounts of their own due to their popularity: the Amityville Haunting in New York and the Enfield Haunting in England.

Amityville in particular skyrocketed Lorraine & Ed Warren into supernatural superstardom and the recordings captured in Enfield are still passed around as evidence of true demonic possession. The Conjuring 3: The Devil Made Me Do It is based on what can be considered the Warrens most controversial case in their resum as it spills into the realm of law for the trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson, a man that denied personal responsibility for the murder of his landlord due to demonic possession.

Unfortunately for the movie, Arnes supernaturally-inclined defense strategy is barely touched on in favor of more traditional but admirably executed scares. Therein lies a missed opportunity, and a good one at that.

Directed by Michael Chaves, The Conjuring 3 starts out with a very clever and viscerally shot exorcism that gives more than a few nods to The Exorcist, from the priests arrival to the possessed partys house to the camera angles favored during the exorcism rite. A little boy is being tormented by an inhuman spirit that transfers to the body of Arne during Ed and Lorraines attempt to rid it back to hell. Arne becomes the possessed subject and ends up killing a man seemingly without provocation (although the movie hints at a possible motive, if only ever so slightly).

Up until the murder and subsequent arrest, the movie reaches horror highs that keep the tension, the dread, and the pure ugliness of demonic possession in a state of intensity that could cause permanent nerve damage. It sets everything up for a dangerous battle for the soul of a man in the face of a murder conviction thats eagerly flirting with the death penalty. In the movie, only the Warrens can prevent Arnes harsh punishment at the hands of the state of Texas.

The movie opts, instead, to go down a more conventional route with the Warrens looking for a devil worshipper that might be pulling the strings behind the scenes. Theres a real threat of danger that puts Ed and Lorraines relationship to test to see if faith and devotion are truly the couples secret weapons.

The result is a story that feels more personal, being that this might be the last time well see Lorraine and Ed on the big screen (for a while at least). It comes off as the closing of a trilogy, complete with callbacks to previous entries and little easter eggs for those whove kept up with the franchise as a whole.

One thing the movie will most definitely be commended for is its breakneck pace. Once the hunt for the new villain begins, it doesnt stop. At times, it carries itself like a ghost procedural, with Ed and Lorraine as its lead detectives. It also harbors a darker tone too, giving off True Detective vibes right down to the color palettes and the overall grittiness of the whole affair. Its a different direction than the previous two movies and it could suggest the franchise will move along these lines in the future.

Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as the Warrens offer the same great performances weve already grown accustomed to, but Ruairi OConnor as Arne is the breakout role here. His interpretation of the possessed man projects honesty and true fear. He plays up Arnes innocence to great effect and makes you want to root for the character.

Its a shame we dont get to see more of him as his character is more a means to an end, a vehicle for the story with the Warrens holding the wheel. I believe the production mightve been afraid the movie was could end up being a retread of The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005), in which the death of a possessed girl during an exorcism leads to a courtroom drama where doubt is cast on both the legal and the spiritual sides of the argument. Having said that, Arnes situation is so unique that it warranted a bit more attention than the story gives him.

As a bonus, readers of the DC Horror Conjuring comic The Lover will find a few connections that link it to the movie. I recommend giving it a read before watching The Conjuring 3 for an extra dose of excitement.

The based on true events aspect of The Conjuring 3 manages to be at its most elusive this time around than ever before. It had the necessary components to be more present and give a different spin on the formula, but its absence only means audiences get a solid Conjuring experience that delivers on scares but couldve actually been truly special.",JM_Doc7_The_Conjuring_3_positive,Jeffrey Mao,Horror,Positive,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Directed by Michael Chaves, who has previously helmed 2019s The Curse of La Llorona, the film has Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson reprising their roles as the Warrens from the previous films.

The horror thriller has a 61% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and the critical consensus reads, The Devil Made Me Do It represents a comedown for the core Conjuring films, although Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson keep the audience invested.


The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is based on the real-life case of Arne Cheyenne Johnson, who claimed in court that he was under demonic possession when he committed a crime. The makers had previously released a featurette that had Arne Cheyenne Johnsons wife speaking about the experience. She shared in the video that it was her baby brother who was the first one to be possessed but later, her husband became possessed as well.

Benjamin Lee of The Guardian found the third film in the franchise better than the previous films. He wrote, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do it is a handsomely made return to form for a series that had been showing signs of fatigue. Delving into their questionable case files once again, this time has the Warrens (played again by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson) dealing with one of their most heavily publicised battles with evil.

NYTs Lena Wilson noted in her review, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is by far the most well-constructed, terrifying entry in the franchise, but its plot relies all too heavily on that same bizarre evangelism. It is an excellently spooky work of fiction. It would be even better if it privileged ghoulishness over gospel.

Owen Gleiberman of The Variety feels the movie lacks that kinetic haunted-house element. He wrote, Its the most somber and meditative and least aggressive of the Conjuring films.",JM_Doc8_The_Conjuring_3_positive,Jeffrey Mao,Horror,Positive,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

This time around, the story is more faced paced and has more of an action-horror feel at times. Its also the first one not directed by James Wan and it does show. However, it also still has many moments featuring great scares.While the pace may feel faster, there is also an increased focus on the romance of Ed and Lorraine Warren. Including scenes that show how they met. To me, this was a nice treat because horror always works better when emotions are involved (to me, anyway). I was more surprised that the actual Arne Johnson story didnt take up much screentime.Continue reading ourThe Conjuring 3: The Devil Made Me Do Itmovie review below.This third time is all about Ed and Lorraine WarrenAs mentioned above,The Conjuring 3is all about Ed and Lorraine Warren. From how they met, to how they work together and the way in which they are constantly met with disbelief. They persevere together which is something weve already seen in the previous two movies.In getting ready for this third movie, I rewatched the previous two and the action did already increase withThe Conjuring 2. In that sense, it seems like a very natural evolution to have an even quicker pace in this movie.Also, Ed Warren continues to try and be the hero, but by now we all know that Lorraine Warren is usually the one who saves the day.Will the same happen in this third movie? Youll have to watch it to find out.Of course, Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson continue to be just perfect as Lorraine and Ed respectively. Ive always liked both actors and inThe Conjuringuniverse, they just make perfect sense. This time around, theyve virtually turned into detectives. Still, I did expect the true story of Arne Johnson to have more screentime.Maybe in the style ofThe Exorcism of Emily Rose(which Ilove) where the trial was the focus and we then saw the demonic events in flashbacks. Theyve gone a very different route with this movie and the whole The Devil Made Me Do It seems to suddenly refer to more people than just Arne Johnson.The subtitle of this third movie was otherwise taken from his defense at the murder trial.When we first see a glimpse of a sinister character in the shadows, I nearly jumped in my seat and thought Wow, is that Doug Jones?! Awesome!. But no, Doug Jones is not inThe Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It. I just got so excited because I thought I saw the likeness of the actor I adore from movies likeOuija: Origin of Evil(2016)orThe Shape of Water(2017).A bit later on, I realize the enormity of my error when I could see that the form was actually female. Its the brilliant actorEugenie Bondurant who we recently saw inFear of Rain. You may also recognize her fromThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay  Part 2. Shes perfect inThe Conjuring 3which just made me hope that well see her in more genre movies soon.For the record, Doug Jones has actually played female characters in the past as a body horror actor.

In other words, it wasnt totally crazy that I thought I saw him at first.Apart from Eugenie Bondurant, we also see the young Julian Hilliard as the boy David who is first possessed when the movie begins. He is such a great horror actor, but we already knew that from watching him portray the young Luke in thebrilliantNetflix horror seriesThe Haunting of Hill HouseandColor Out of Space.WatchThe Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do Itnow!The director ofThe Conjuring 3: The Devil Made Me Do Itis Michael Chaves who is already familiar withThe Conjuringuniverse. In fact, his feature film debut as a director was withThe Curse of La Llorona(2019). A movie I was in no way impressed by despite adoring the woman who starred in it.Fortunately, Michael Chaves works much better as a director this time around for me. Also, the script seems much better. Its by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick who co-wroteThe Conjuring 2. He also wrote on some of the more recent episodes ofThe Walking Dead(which have finally gotten watch-worthy again) and debuted as a writer withOrphan(2009)also starring Vera Farmiga.While I do thinkThe Conjuring 3is the weakest of the three movies in the trilogy (which might have more movies added to it), I would stilldefinitely recommendit. I would give it a 3? out of 5 but have no problem rounding up since we dont do half ratings.

100,JRH_Doc10_The_King_Of,"Even Pete Davidsons lo-fi charms cant energise this baggy, can-kicking Judd Apatow slacker-com.Under Apatows direction Davidson plays a thinly veiled version of himself: a twentysomething Staten Island stoner living in his mothers basement, still grappling with the loss of his firefighter father, who died when he was a kid. But whereas Davidson found stand-up comedy and joined the cast of Saturday Night Live, Carlin is afraid to leave the safety of his perpetually hazy man cave. Instead, he sells pills with his buddies, jokes about opening a combination tattoo parlour and restaurant (Ruby Tattoos-days) and admits, Theres something wrong with me mentally, like, Im not okay.After years spent dodging the responsibilities of adulthood, Carlinhas his life upendedwhen his younger sister (Maude Apatow) leaves for college and his mother (Marisa Tomei) begins dating Ray (Bill Burr), who just happens to be a firefighter. While Carlin clearly wants his mum to be happy, hes resistant to her entering a relationship with another man who puts his life on the line, bluntly stating, Look what happened last time. His contentious interactions with Ray dont help the situation, leading his mother to issue an ultimatum: its time for Carlin to move out, get a job and start taking care of himself.Forced out of his comfort zone, Carlin churns through a variety of possible futures: he busses tables at a local pizzeria, pursues a tattoo parlour apprenticeship, becomes an accomplice to an attempted robbery, briefly entertains the idea of enrolling in college and cleans toilets at a Staten Island fire station. But by the time the credits roll, theres still no clear indication of what path Carlin will take or, perhaps more importantly, how hell confront the lasting psychological toll of his fathers death.Playing a more troubled variation of himself isnt much of a stretch for Davidson, and theres a likeability to his default underachieving bro persona thats endearing, if not exactly captivating (much like his recent turn in Big Time Adolescence). Hes at his best when trading barbs with Apatow as his concerned sister or playing off the subtle warmth of Tomei, who solidifies herself as Hollywoods go-to mom. Its not until late in the film that Steve Buscemi  briefly featured in the role of a veteran fireman  steals the show with the films most heartfelt monologue, candidly reminiscing about Carlins father over drinks at an appropriately dingy Staten Island dive bar.Unfortunately, the talented cast and authentic locales arent enough to combat sluggish script, filled with superfluous tangents that inflate the runtime past two hours. It doesnt help that the film seems afraid to open up in any meaningful way about its main characters mental health problems, which is surprising considering how candid Davidson has been about his own battles. Like a slacker resistant to efficiency or introspection The King of Staten Island is content to coast, with Apatow overseeing an aimless story uncharacteristically light on laughs that ultimately proves to be a royal waste of time.",JRH_Doc10_The_King_Of,Jenna Honeywell,Comedy,Negative,The King of Staten Island
101,JRH_Doc1_The_King_Of,"Id never laid eyes onPete Davidsonbefore, nor have I ever set foot on Staten Island in all the time Ive spent in New York City; nobody has ever remotely recommended it, although I must say that one scene inThe King of Staten Islandshot at the local minor league baseball park affords so spectacular a view of Manhattan across the water beyond centerfield that I may have to take in a game there next time Im in town.Happily, the distant scenery is not allJudd Apatows new film has going for it, far from it. The directors first film sinceTrainwreckfive years ago, written by him along with Davidson and Dave Sirus, has the solid lived-in feel of a working class community in which everyone not only knows each other but pokes their noses into other peoples business and has to tolerate, shall we say, less than well-mannered behavior on the part of their relatives and neighbors. Theyre rude, theyre slobs, theyre layabouts, theyre no-accounts and they all speak in clichs as if theyve learned their entire vocabularies from watching TV. Its a film full of characters who have to say Im sorry a lot. Bottom line, thoughtheyre all quite recognizably and vibrantly human.Being an Apatow film also means that the people on view for an excessive 136 minutes are, for the most part, compulsively disputatious and often very funny. The king in question is Davidsons Scott Carlin, a 24-year-old, heavily tatted lay-about who lives with mom Margie (Marissa Tomei) and sister Claire (Maude Apatow, the directors 22-year-old daughter) in a cramped suburban-style house. Fireman Dad died on the job on 9/11.Scotts ambitions soar no higher than becoming an apprentice at a tattoo parlor; any thoughts of going to college are quashed by an old guy who warns him that Jimmy Hoffa, Bill Cosby and Donald Trump, among others, all partook of higher education. It takes a little getting used to Scott; none-too-bright, hes a slob, almost always contrary or uncooperative, has an excuse for everything and dares to profess no ambition. When he admits that, I think Im just stupid, one can think of no reason not to agree, although he does emit a certain sweetness that bubbles up through the cracks every now and then. And he does make his sort-of girlfriend Kelsey (Bel Powley) happy in the sack.Satisfaction of that nature has not been the case for Margie for 17 years until she meets Ray (Bill Burr), a lively straight-shooter who iswhat else?a fireman. Combustion between them is such that its soon suggested that Scott should move out and get his own place, triggering a reaction from him perfectly appropriate to 12-year-old. When the young man later loudly and proudly proclaims, We are the millennials!, you fear for the future of the very world.This crisis does serve to switch the films momentum from first to second gear, but Apatow shows little concern for picking up  ",JRH_Doc1_The_King_Of,Jenna Honeywell,Comedy,Positive,The King of Staten Island
102,JRH_Doc2_Pete_Davidson_Opens,"Unlike some of his past and present co-stars onSaturday Night Live, Davidson is not a virtuoso comic actor  perhaps not primarily an actor at all.Beyond his undeniably distinctive physical appearance  the sloppy, lumbering body language, the staring eyes and nearly cartoonish grin  what is the point of him, exactly? What is hefor? The theory of Judd ApatowsThe King of Staten Islandis that audiences can learn to love Davidson for his vulnerability  the lost-little-boy quality which has been central to the Apatow brand since his breakout success directing Steve Carell asThe Forty-Year-Old Virgin.Scripted by Apatow, Davidson and fellow comic Dave Sirius, the film incorporates elements of Davidsons real-life story, as if to suggest what might have become of him if he hadnt struck it lucky.He plays Scott Carlin, an aspiring tattoo artist who grew up like Davidson on Staten Island, characterised as far and away the least glamorous of New Yorks five boroughs. At 24, Scott is reluctant to leave the nest, living at home with his mother, Margie (Marisa Tomei), a nurse in an emergency ward, and his younger sister, Claire (Maude Apatow).While the themes may be familiar, this is a long way from the upscale showbiz milieu where Apatow is most at home, andThe King of Staten Islandis notably lower key than his earlier productions (the designated genre is comedy-drama).But it has the same loose, baggy format as the others, leaving room for hyperbolic comic situations, such as a scene where Scott decides to practice his tattooing skills on a small boy (Luke David Blumm), and the kind of improvised riffing heard in podcasts where comics strive to top one another.Whatever the film may do for Davidsons career, its not a showcase for his previously untapped range. Rather, the script is tailored to his capacity to convey a handful of emotions, moving between wiseguy rebellion, childish rage and pathetic neediness like a ramped-up version of Apatows old pal Adam Sandler.Yet there's a quality in Davidson that works against this special pleading: partly due to his physical size, he cuts a more imposing figure than the usual Apatow nerd. Like him or not, hes undeniably some kind of presence, at once abashed and unapologetic, as if his goal were less winning our sympathy than self-exposure for its own sake.Your response toThe King of Staten Islandwill depend almost entirely on how you respond to its star. But if youre prepared to give Davidson a chance, Apatows entertainment instincts and a well-chosen supporting cast are enough to ensure the film never becomes an outright drag  or only in the final half-hour, which relies on a string of contrivances to get to the sentimental finish.One minor surprise: though full-frontal male nudity has long been one of Apatows comic trademarks, Davidson never gets to the point of letting it all hang out. Perhaps hes a tad more modest than he appears  or perhaps the consensus was ",JRH_Doc2_Pete_Davidson_Opens,Jenna Honeywell,Comedy,Positive,The King of Staten Island
103,JRH_Doc3_The_King_Of,"It is a biography that reads very close to Davidson's own life story (his firefighter father, also called Scott, died trying to save others as a 9/11 first responder).Not exactly a stretch for Davidson the actor, then. I imagine there weren't a lot of ""Hey, Judd, what's my motivation?"" type conversations between lead actor and director. But, maybe, playing a fictional role largely based on your own back story is far harder than taking on the role of a totally different character altogether.Pete Davidson is not Scott Carlin in the way that Larry David is a heightened version of himself in Curb Your Enthusiasm.And yet, anybody who knows Davidson's stand-up work will see similar traits: the low-status schtick, the poking fun but not being mean - or being mean and then apologising afterwards. The dry delivery, the ill-fitting clothes, the off-beat persona. These characteristics are all evident in Scott Carlin, too, but somehow Davidson manages to shape him in such a way that the fictional character becomes so vivid it obscures the identity of the man playing him. That's not an easy trick to pull off.Davidson does it with plenty of help from his friends. Fellow stand-up comic Bill Burr plays Ray Bishop, a straight-talking, shirt-tucked-in kinda guy, who provides a nicely weighted counter-point to Scott and his haphazard lifestyle. Ray has eyes for Margie (the excellent Marisa Tomei), the long-suffering mother of Scott and his preppy younger sister Claire (Maude Apatow). That's one love story.The other is between Scott and his girlfriend Kelsey, a young woman hell-bent on putting Staten Island on the hipster map. She is played by the British actress Bel Powley, who was one of the few good things about Apple TV's The Morning Show (buckle up, there's a second season on the way). She doesn't have many scenes, but those she is in are some of the best in the movie - there'll be an Oscar on her shelf one of these days.There is also a very welcome cameo-plus from Steve Buscemi as Papa the fire chief, and a short but memorable appearance by Machine Gun Kelly in the guise of a tattoo shop owner.Judd Apatow does a good job keeping all the moving parts in order, although the pace could be a bit slow for some. It wasn't a problem for me, it's not as if there's a whole load to do right now. What's more, you sense a looseness that allowed the actors room to explore and improvise, which gives the film an edge it might otherwise lack.It also affords the viewer a chance to reflect while watching. And when you do, it becomes apparent The King of Staten Island is more than a run-of-the-mill genre movie. It is a brutally honest, first-person account of what can happen to a family when tragedy strikes. It's not hyperbolic or overly-dramatic. It's just sad and downbeat at times. It is not a new story, but well told.",JRH_Doc3_The_King_Of,Jenna Honeywell,Comedy,Positive,The King of Staten Island
104,JRH_Doc4_The_King_Of,"He isnt just stuck; hes psychologically unmoored, something Apatow wants to wrestle from minute one.The script makes a major effort to wrestle with the trauma underlying Scotts immaturity. Davidson, lively and raw stand-up comic, has always seemed like a fairly limited actor inSaturday Night Livesketches, but his performance here is stripped-down and honest. Scott can be quite charming and gregarious, and then immensely frustrating; hes delightful when hanging in the basement with his stoned pals (played by Moiss Arias, Ricky Velez, and Lou Wilson), but inadvertently neglectful of his mother, Margie (Marisa Tomei), and sister, Claire (Maude Apatow). The loss of his father in the line of duty looms over everything, and Judd Apatow and Davidson are unafraid to depict what an emotional crutch that history has become for Scott, who uses it as an excuse for his irresponsibility.Apatows meandering style fits Scotts flaky personality, but it makes the first half of the movie feel particularly formless. Individual scenes are funny and well acted, but theres no real arc to latch onto besides Scotts adventures in amateur tattooing, a profession he craves but lacks the discipline for. A romantic subplot between Scott and his pal Kelsey (Bel Powley) is kept super-casual, and after the frightening opening scene depicting his dangerous driving, the film pulls back from showing anything that intense, instead basking in Scotts unseriousness. His jokiness is a defense mechanism, but that could have easily been communicated with greater narrative focus. Other, plottier moments, like a bodega robbery Scotts involved in that goes sideways, feel abrupt and unearned.In the latter half of the film, Apatow finally starts to home in on the point of his tale, and thats whenThe King of Staten Islandbecomes compelling and moving. Margie starts dating another firefighter, the gloriously mustachioed Ray (Bill Burr), and Scott is suddenly compelled to hang out with Ray and his work crew, including the no-nonsense Papa (Steve Buscemi), an old colleague of his fathers. This is more emotionally muddy territory than Apatow usually ventures into, and its told with visual simplicity. Other hits relied on celebrity cameos and bumped up against the world of show business, a way to work easy, crowd-pleasing jokes into the sort of personal comedy Apatow likes to make.The King of Staten Islandcant rely on that kind of glitzy material, so instead it digs into the human tragedy at the heart of Scotts life. There are fewer punchy one-liners and trailer-ready jokes, and more weighty conversations about the dangerous allure of the work that claimed Scotts fathers life. But because theyre played with straightforward authenticity, those exchanges are breezier than the movies first hour. Apatows greatest skill is at dissecting relationships, and that shouldve made up most ofThe King of Staten Islands running time. Yes, the film is a tale of a young man facing his demons, but it works best as the story of a ruptured family finally learning how to put things back together.",JRH_Doc4_The_King_Of,Jenna Honeywell,Comedy,Positive,The King of Staten Island
105,JRH_Doc5_As_The_King,"In theory,The King of Staten Islandthe script is by Apatow, Davidson, and SNL writer Dave Sirusis intended to dig deeper than previous Apatow films, with its focus on loss, sacrifice, and especially mental health. In practice though, it deals with these subjects largely by incremental omission. The very first scene finds Scott driving his car with eyes squeezed shut and music blaring, leading to a dangerous high-speed sideswipe. We never see this level of self-endangerment again. Likewise, his bouts of emotional volatility become less frequent, and his initially dire-seeming condition (bipolar disorder?) is ultimately revealed to be grief and ADD. Can one argue that this trajectory represents Scotts gradual recovery? Sure. But it felt to me more as though Apatow was inching carefully away from his setup, to the far more familiar terrain of arrested adolescence. In this, it resembles previous Apatow movies, with the noteworthy exception of hisunderratedFunny People, which achieved its greatest moral complexity in its final act.Indeed, the whole film, while eminently enjoyable, has a slightly loose and lazy quality. Storylines appear (Scotts relationships with Rays kids and with Gina, a robbery gone bad, etc.) and then are forgotten for long stretches. Though the elements are individually solid, the fit between them is awkward.The same might also be said of Davidsons portrayal of Scott. The comedians performanceswhether doing stand-up or on SNLalways feel a bit like high-wire acts, the work of someone who has talent that he doesnt yet know how to fully control. This is true inThe King of Staten Islandas well, and complicated by the fact that Davidson is essentially playing a version of himself who was not rescued by a career in comedy. Theres something tentative about the performance, in which the line between acting and merely being is often blurry. Davidson is by no means bad, he just occasionally feels like a bystander in his own movie.The rest of the cast help him carry the film, however, in particular Tomei and Burr, whose cuddly chemistry is an outright delight, and Steve Buscemi, who has a small but appealingly avuncular role as a veteran fireman. And the movie bounces along likably upon waves of Apatow banter, with gags on everything from catfishing to bedbugs to a very poorly timed ringtone of the theme toThe Office.In some ways,The King of Staten Islandresembles its own view of the forgotten borough where its set: familiar, comfortable, but with room for improvement. Its Gina who puts it best. Shes bent on passing a civil-service test so she can work in city planning and help turn Staten Island into the next Brooklyn. We dont get any cool people from any of the other boroughs, she explains. No one comes here. Were stuck with the fucking pricks who live here.

Its issues and problems never sat well with me, while some of its more blatantly cartoonishly comedic subplots flat-out didnt work. And while the two-plus hour length never bothered me, I equally cant say the filmmaker was able to hold my rapt attention for every second of this 136-minute running time, its methodically-paced plotting only calling attention to the more distasteful aspects of the narrative that left a sour taste in my mouth.But the cast kept eyes glued to the screen. Everyone bringd their A-game, delivering superior performances even when the material lets them down. Powley steals every scene shes in. Tomei reminds us all that herMy Cousin VinnyOscar (and additional nominations forIn the BedroomandThe Wrestler) was hardly a fluke. While I cant say I appreciated their story arc that still doesnt mean Velez, Arias and especially Wilson arent a joy to watch every time theyre up on the screen, while a relatively brief, albeit critically important supporting turn fromSteve Buscemiis nothing less than sublime. A for Burr, the man blew me away, and if he were to somehow manage to land a Supporting Actor Academy Award nomination for his performance I cant say Id be anything resembling surprised. Hes that terrific.Davidson shocked me. I never knew he had something like this in him. He holds the screen with remarkable confidence, and the emotional transformation Scott goes through during the final act is nothing less than stunning. Its all thanks the electrifying intensity of Davidsons performance. Hes is marvelous, and theres not much more that needs to be said on the matter.For reasons that I will not disclose, there is a point where Scott ends up residing at Rays firehouse. It is during this section where the film comes alive as it never had before that moment. Apatows writing becomes far more dynamic, while his juggling of the various comedic and dramatic elements is up to the high standards Ive come to expect from the director. Theres a level of budding introspective insight that I felt had been previously missing, all of which allows the motion picture to find its footing and climax on a memorable high that almost makes me willing to forgive all of the elements I didnt particularly care for.Im having trouble doing it that, and as strong as the ending might be my dissatisfaction with the first hour isnt vanishing. Thanks primarily to Davidsons star-making turn I have a feeling most will be far more forgiving to Apatows latest than I will be.

There are familiar beats with Scott and his group of friends hanging out, getting high,watching movies and goofing on each other, and true to movies like these, Scott has commitment issues with his kind-of girlfriend Kelsey, and keeps their relationship a secret.But those matters as well as an awkward heist subplot that is of so little consequence it could easily be lifted out of the film without making a ripple in the story  take a backseat to Scott's forced bonding with Ray (Bill Burr), a firefighter who starts dating his mother (Marisa Tomei).When Scott is kicked out of his house he goes to live with Ray at the firehouse, and he finally begins to sort through the feelings of loss and abandonment the death of his father left him with years ago. And at one point there's a cathartic singalong to the Wallflowers' ""One Headlight.""There are fragments of several different movies lying around the periphery of ""The King of Staten Island,"" but the story never truly comes together. Davidson, who turned in a similar performance in ""Big Time Adolescence"" earlier this year (and is frankly a bit old for coming-of-age stories), is consistently dwarfed by the dramatic demands of the role, and the script never manages to dialinto the emotional torment of his character's internal struggles. And the laughs that would normally bail out a movie as at odds with itself as this one never arrive.Within the scattered narrative, it's Powley's Kelsey who comes out the winner, and the most realized character in the film.Kelsey has a goal to get a job working for the city of Staten Island so she can shine a light on the positives of the area for all to see, and the Brit's performance is so grounded and rooted she could pass for a native of the Island.

108,JRH_Doc8_The_King_Of,"Pete Davidson hasn't exactly blazed new trails in his film roles, and that's Apatow, Davidson and ""SNL"" writer Dave Sirus collaborated on the script, which casts Davidson as a 24-year-old slacker principally devoted to hanging out with his goofy friends and smoking pot. His Scott has never gotten over the death of his dad, a firefighter, mirroring Davidson's loss of his dad (also named Scott) at a young age on Sept. 11, 2001.What sets the story in motion, though, involves Scott less than the women around him -- specifically, his younger sister (Maude Apatow, the director's daughter), who graduates high school and heads off to college; and their mom (Marisa Tomei), who, faced with a half-empty nest, embarks on a new romance with Ray (Bill Burr), as it happens, also a firefighter.Suddenly, Scott faces the prospect of having to get his act together beyond his vague dreams of becoming a tattoo artist. That also has implications for his noncommittal relationship with Kelsey (Bel Powley), a local gal who wants more, both out of him and life.Like his last role in the Hulu movie""Big Time Adolescence,""Davidson is basically playing another Peter Pan type, a boy who refuses to grow up. The extent to which he'll be forced to change provides the movie's foundation, although that's frankly more interesting as seen through the eyes of his mom and her new boyfriend, whose courtship has a sweetness and depth that Scott's interactions lack.Ray tries to be a good soldier by bonding with Scott, introducing him to his firefighter buddies, a group that includes a veteran leader played by Steve Buscemi. It's around here, though, where ""King of Staten Island"" begins to telegraph sappier qualities that are characteristic of Apatow's films, which tend to mix blunt comedy (a double entendre, that) with warm and fuzzy flourishes.The drawback of all that is the movie drags on for 137 minutes, which feels like considerably more than the familiar premise and its aimless central character can fully support. That's despite the able supporting lineup, which in addition to fine work by Tomei and Burr features Pamela Adlon (""Better Things"") as Ray's feisty ex-wife.Davidson himself, of course, found a more lucrative outlet for his talents than Scott pursues, but other wrinkles -- from battling depression to growing up with a widowed mom -- hew pretty closely to hiswell-documented biography.Plenty of ""SNL"" stars have made the jump to movies, and this conspicuously feels like a test of Davidson's appeal, in a vehicle tailor-made for him.We'll never know if the Davidson-Apatow combination -- given the latter's track record with comedic talent like Steve Carell (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"") and Amy Schumer (""Trainwreck"") -- would have enticed people to theaters, which was to have been the movie's destination before coronavirus. As is, it's at best an OK way to hunker down at home if you're feeling as unmotivated as its protagonist and have nothing better to do for a few hours.",JRH_Doc8_The_King_Of,Jenna Honeywell,Comedy,Negative,The King of Staten Island

The director cant help but inexorably bend what begins as a more chaotic portrayal into the kind of story he loves best  that of arrested development.The King of Staten Islandacknowledges Scotts inner turmoil in its opening scene, in which the character turns up the radio while hes driving and then closes his eyes, flirting with death and almost getting in an accident. But after that, his trauma and his mental disorders become more abstract, things that are spoken about rather than put on screen. During a dalliance with his reluctant fuck buddy Kelsey, he discusses his inability to orgasm due to his meds, and then begs off telling their friends about their non-relationship: Im scared of myself and I dont want to, like, scare you or me or like hurt anyone, so I think itd just be best and really responsible of me if I just backed off. Scotts self-proclaimed fucked-up-ness has become a reason for him to not engage with anything seriously, or even try. And while theres something very real about that, itd feel more convincing if that fucked-up-ness were explored instead of shunted aside like an excuse.The development that nudges Scott, an aspiring tattoo artist, toward his delayed coming-of-age involves his mothers love life. Hes unknowingly responsible for Margie having an acerbic meet-cute with Ray that blossoms into her first real relationship since the death of her husband 17 years ago. Scotts supportive until he learns that Rays also a firefighter, a fact that triggers all sorts of repressed emotions that emerge as self-centered protests. Apatows not afraid of a luxuriant run time, and these storylines all seem like theyre meant to express the teeming messiness of life. But theres a slack inconclusiveness to each that makes them instead feel vestigial, especially the swerve into crime, snipped into something almost incoherent. The result is that, while we spend a lot of time in Scotts company, hes tiresomely static for most of it, a childish dick to his mom and sister, unrelentingly hostile to Ray, opportunistic toward Kelsey, and shockingly careless with his only pals.The King of Staten Islandshrinks Davidson down a little too much, to the point where his pathos and humor doesnt blend with but actively gets obscured by his immaturity. By the time Scott takes some faltering steps toward responsibility, the movie feels too much like one weve seen before  from Apatow, especially, with his tendency to send his heroes staggering like toddlers toward the long-suffering women in their lives, standing around with their hands on their hips, waiting for them to grow up. It hardly feels like it addresses whats most interesting about Davidson, whos playing a character but still mostly playing himself.

Individually, theyre the kind of action scenes that any other franchise would be proud to build their entire movie around and call it a day, but they never quite reach the heights of the series best, like Rogue Nations plane sequence or the jaw-dropping skyscraper spectacle of Ghost Protocol.
That is, until its climax. The cinematic equivalent of multiple orgasms, Fallouts final act features wave after wave of breathless action with callouts to previous films in the franchise and utterly batshit crazy moments, cutting between our heroes in various locations as they try to stop the villains, repeatedly upping the ante and the ridiculousness.
But the latest film, a direct sequel to the last one, isnt all action. Fallout bests its predecessors in actually creating a coherent plot, albeit not entirely original (not that thats what were here for). And its McGuffin isnt even really a McGuffin  its plutonium. Anyone who follows the news (and isnt making it via Twitter rants) immediately understands the real-life dangers inherent in villains having access to nuclear weapons; this isnt some object whose implications are unclear or is just made up to serve the plot of a spy movie. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) jets across the globe, going from Paris to London and beyond in the attempt to secure the plutonium and keep it out of the hands of a group of terrorists who call themselves The Apostles, disciples ofSolomon Lane (Sean Harrisplaying the antagonistfrom Rogue Nation) and his now-splintered Syndicate.
With each film prior to Fallout, the Mission: Impossible series has offered a new directors take on Hunt and the IMF, but the sixth outing is the first to repeat both a director Christopher McQuarrie and the villain. Hes in league with The Apostles, and itll require all of Hunts talents to save the world from destruction, along with help from forced-upon-him CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg). Elsa (Rebecca Ferguson) and Hunley (Alec Baldwin) return, though its initially unclear what their part will be in Hunts mission.
Cruises Hunt has at once never been more human and more superhuman. Fallout revolves around his fallibility, with a choice he makes early on that put the entire world on the line and smaller moments where hes getting beaten up, falling or simply failing. Theres also even more of an emphasis by McQuarries script on Hunts personal and professional relationships and how they affect what he does for a living, but its admittedly relative texture. But Hunt (and Cruise) still has seemingly unending stamina, performing feats of strength and speed that are just silly. Even though we cant possibly believe what hes doing, whether its free climbing a rock face (again) or speeding past landmarks on a motorcycle (again), its all a blast for the audience. Theres a delirious joy in watching this much action, this well executed at every level, from Cruise and the cast (and their stunt doubles) to McQuarrie.
To mix things up visually from Rogue Nation, the director switches his director of photography fromRobert ElswittoRob Hardyfor this go-round. Hardy has previously worked withAlex Garlandon Annihilation and Ex Machina, and while Fallout isnt as gorgeous as those films, he ably captures the scope and scale, whether hes careening through Parisian alleys or tumbling over remote mountains. Though McQuarrie initially gained fame as the Oscar-winning screenwriter of The Usual Suspects, the dialogue is the weak point of the film. Its easy to overlook, sandwiched between car chases and said by talented actors (particularly Cavill, his mustache and the underusedAngela Bassett), but it thuds on screen with far less grace than the athletic stars who are saddled with it.By the time most franchises hit their sixth film, theres a sense of been-there, done-that and a lack of inventiveness and energy, but Mission: Impossible is the rare exception that repeats itself and still provides ample relentless thrills. Sure, theyve been to Paris and London before and weve seen Hunt in similarly tight situations, but pure adrenaline-powered exhilaration overpowers the faults of familiarity. Fights are visceral, and we feel every punch (especially Cavills double-barreledpump-action punches). The car and motorcycle chases leave us panting, and a dazzling aerial sequence feels like the visceral terror of falling out of a plane. In choosing between going big or going home, Fallout absolutely goes for broke. Sure, its mission implausible, but for those that appreciate the hyperbolic fireworks of this series you should experience it on as a gigantic a screen as possible. Yes, Fallout is bonkers, and youll want to be caught in its preposterous, but intense blast radius.

This is one blockbuster that really uses  and deserves  the big screen.If you dont remember the last film, though  wasnt that the one with someone hanging off a jet?  you may need some catching up. So just know that our secret-agent hero, Cruises Ethan Hunt, is back in trouble, this time for letting some plutonium fall into the wrong hands.His assignment? Team up with pals Luther and Benji and track it down  whatever it takes.Complicating things? It may take freeing a global terrorist  and evading the bullets of his old MI6 frenemy, Ilsa Faust.Even going into the movie armed with that knowledge  and this is the kind of movie where everyone is armed  you may get a little lost at times.
The screenwriter is Christopher McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, and he likes overcomplicating things. Keeping track of all the subplots can be a little like solving a Rubiks cube. In the dark.
But McQuarrie, who also directed here, helmed the last installment, too (and Cruises Jack Reacher, as well as working on the scripts for his Valkyrie and Edge of Tomorrow.) So, you already know two important facts.One, he knows how to stage action scenes. And two, he has his stars trust.Mission: Impossible  Fallout depends on both.A fight scene in a bathroom is both a choreographed spectacle, and a stylish explosion of white tile and crimson blood. A defuse-the-bomb sequence triples the ante by dividing it into three race-against-time climaxes.But the M: I franchise is also Cruises baby, a project hes carefully expanded while always carrying it squarely on his shoulders. And you need a director who knows that, and how to show this star off to his advantage. One way is to always give him something to do  jump out a plane, jump on a motorcycle, run down the street, fists pumping. You can lose calories just watching the guy.The other, just as important way is to tone down his natural arrogance. Cruise can come off like a Level VII know-it-all, but here hes confident, not cocky. His superspy is making it up as he goes along. And his biggest worry is that you know that.He gets some great support from his co-stars, too. Ving Rhames has become so solidly impressive, he deserves his own zip code. Simon Pegg adds comic relief and Henry Cavill provides a sturdy obstacle as a rival CIA agent.Meanwhile, Michele Monaghan, missing for a while, makes a brief appearance as Hunts wife-in-hiding. Rebecca Ferguson is back as Ilsa, too, and Vanessa Kirby from The Crown drops by for a bit as a sexy villain.Or is she?Her characters motivations are a little obscure, and her name  the White Widow  made her sound like a refugee from a Marvel movie. But she survives the picture, and were guessing shell be back for the next one. And I really hope there is a next one.Because this is one mission you dont ever want to end.",MH_Doc1_Mission_Impossible_Fallout_Review_Positive,Michael Hesche,Action,Positive,Mission Impossible Fallout

Cruise is among Hollywoods last surviving superstars.And yet look at what this man is willing to endure to entertain us. In this film, he breaks his ankle  for real, leaps out of a plane at 25,000 feet, hangs from a helicopter and flies it, drives a high-speed motorcycle through Paris, leaps from innumerable terraces and runs so fast and so hard that I got exhausted just looking at him.Did I mention that he is 56?
Here Cruise once again partners with Christopher McQuarrie, who is the first director to helm two films in the 22-year-oldMission: Impossiblefranchise. McQuarrie, who earlier directedRogue Nation, makes the action set-pieces grander and even more bonkers. He also adds emotional heft. Ethan Hunts inherent goodness and sincerity become genuinely moving. Strands from Hunts past are woven into the story  he is vulnerable and in places, even frail.The film acknowledges Cruises years. Despite the physical prowess, we see him tiring as he fights. We see him get beat up.We see his white stubble.We recognize that he is human.And yet, when Luther says of Hunt, He will get it done, we dont doubt it for a second.Because since the firstMission: Impossiblein 1996, Hunt has never let us down.
That first film was my favorite in the series. None of the subsequent installments were duds but the memory of these films started to blur. I started to identify them by the stunts  soGhost Protocolwas the one in which Cruise climbed the Burj Khalifa and inRogue Nation, he was hanging from the side of a plane. ButFalloutis an absolute knockout. This film is a staggering action spectacle and easily the best since the first.
The story revolves around homicidal terrorists who get their hands on plutonium. These folks want to wreak havoc on the world because they believe that the greater the pain, the greater the piece.But Hunt gets in the way.He is relentless in his pursuit. He is also unfailing in his mission to protect  the film establishes clearly that this man isnt willing to compromise a single life, even for the larger good of humanity.This pathetic morality, can sometimes be a stumbling block. But it is what makes Hunt who he is.
McQuarrie, who has also written the screenplay, skillfully alternates the emotion with action. Some of which is so propulsive and insane that it makes you gasp  one jaw-dropping sequence takes place in a pristine white bathroom, which eventually becomes stained with blood.I knew Hunt would come out okay and yet the climax, which involves ticking bombs, helicopters, and snowy mountain cliffs, is so suspenseful that I was squealing loudly. Incidentally the sequence is supposed to be set in Kashmir but here New Zealand is filling in and we get barely any sense that we are in India. At two and half hours,Falloutis also a tad too long.
Apart from Cruise, the film is bolstered by the usual suspects  Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg playing Hunts team members. Theres also a trio of fabulous women  Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan and Angela Bassett, who plays the CIA director.At one point, she disdainfully declares: IMF is Halloween  a bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick or treat.Theres also Henry Cavill, showing us that he can do much more than be Superman.",MH_Doc2_Mission_Impossible_Fallout_Review_Positive,Michael Hesche,Action,Positive,Mission Impossible Fallout

But in the superb Mission: Impossible  Fallout, Cruise seems more energetic than he did back when he jumped on Oprahs couch.
Here, Cruise leaps, parkour-like, across London rooftops. He jumps out of a plane at 25,000 feet. He pilots a helicopter through the mountains. When the 57-year-old Roger Moore starred in A View to a Kill, he spent most of that movie in front of a green screen pretending to snowboard.NotCruise.
The actors complete willingness to treat his body like a crash-test dummy is part of what makes Mission: Impossible the best ongoing action series out there. The other is its simple, high-stakes setups.
Fallout, for instance, could have been titled Mission: Impossible  Find the Nukes.Hunts mission, which he chooses to accept, is to recover three plutonium cores for sale on the black market. The IMF, his intelligence agency, has learned theyll be used by a boneheaded scientist to build weapons to forge a new world order. The greater the suffering, the greater the peace, the madman says in his wacko manifesto.
Hunts geek squad (Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg) tracks the plutonium to Paris, where its to be sold by a broker called the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby).
Kirby, who played Princess Margaret on The Crown, is smashing as the Widow, a character whos big, searching eyes betray either genius or lunacy.
Also around is cranky Agent Walker (Henry Cavill), a CIA operative sent along by an agency head (Angela Bassett) who has little faith in Hunts abilities. Spies have office politics too!Together, they try to retrieve the nukes, and save the world.
The access the filmmakers get to certain international locations is jaw-dropping. There is a destructive motorcycle chase through Paris that passes through the Champs-lyses and around the Arc de Triomphe. Later, Hunt runs on foot through St. Pauls Cathedral in London. Less glam is a helicopter chase through Kashmir, but its the films most gripping sequence.
Beyond the action, which makes the Marvel Cinematic Universe look cute, the thrills of Fallout come from its double-crosses and sinister motives. While some characters are blatantly treasonous jerks, there are a few genuinely shocking revelations.
Its Cruises performance that makes those moments land. Although physically formidable, the guys character is naive. He believes in the world at its best, even though he sees its worst. So, whenever Hunts betrayed, he acts like a little boy who thought he was going to the pool only to discover hes on the way to the dentist.
Writer and director Christopher McQuarrie borrows just the right amount of familiar spy tropes in his second M: I outing, and his film, while intelligent and witty, never becomes too self-serious or chatty. Its the best night out at the movies so far this summer.
Still, the Mission: Impossible franchise would be nothing without Cruise. While younger, more generic action stars pop up every year in paint-by-numbers, explosion-heavy drudgery, its Cruise who remains top gun.",MH_Doc3_Mission_Impossible_Fallout_Review_Positive,Michael Hesche,Action,Positive,Mission Impossible Fallout

Soak it in like a day at the beach, because big time blockbuster filmmaking is rarely this well executed or more satisfying.
Tom Cruise is back, looking awesome (does he age?)and risking his life for your entertainment as Ethan Hunt, the Impossible Missions Force super-spy who's once again trying to save the world from a dastardly terrorist plot. This one involvessome plutonium and the annihilation of millions of lives; in other words, it's a normal day at the office for Mr. Hunt.
What it's really about is a smattering of masterfully executed action set pieces, and ""Fallout"" has some absolute stunners, meeting or exceeding the already high bar the series has set for itself. (To be fair, the dizzying Burj Khalifa sequence in ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" still stands as a series high point, but several ""Fallout"" sequences rival it.)
Along for the ride are series regulars Ving Rhames (on board since the first ""Mission""), Simon Pegg (who joined the squad in ""3"") and Alec Baldwin (who debuted in ""5""). New to the fold are Angela Basset, who playsCIA director Erica Sloane, and Henry Cavill, the ""Superman"" brick wall who looks like a bulked up Armie Hammer, as CIA muscle whomSloane assigns to tag along with Hunt. (Jeremy Renner, who was in the last two ""Missions,"" sits this one out, just as he was on the sidelines for ""Avengers: Infinity War."" Someone needs to get on the phone with hisagent, just saying.)
Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, a Cruise pal since he penned 2008's ""Valkyrie,"" has become Cruise's closest creative partner in recent years, writing the scripts for ""Edge of Tomorrow"" and ""The Mummy,"" and writing and directing ""Jack Reacher"" and 2015's ""Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol.""
Here, McQuarrie's script delivers some delicious double and triple crosses; remember, this is the guy who won an Oscar for ""The Usual Suspects,"" so he knows a thing or two about pulling one over on an audience.
Andhis direction makes references to not only ""Mission: Impossibles"" past (the rock climbing sequence from ""M:I-2"" gets a nod) but also Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" films and the bathroom brawl from James Cameron's ""True Lies.""
Against the threat of nuclear Armageddon, Hunt skydives in a lightning storm, turns the streets of Paris into his personal motorcycle track, runs through most of London by foot (what would a Tom Cruise vehicle be without a heart-stopping scene of Cruise running?) and winds up in a helicopter chase through theHimalayas.
The action is so riveting it excuses a standard issue climactic deviceinvolving a ticking bomb countdown, recurring references to something called a ""microwave transponder"" andcheese-dipped dialogue such as, ""the plutonium is still out there!""
Because with Cruise in full go-hard-or-go-home mode  the rooftop stunt where he broke several bones during production is included in the finished product  there's nothing to do but sit back in awe of a movie star going this far to please audiences. Dwayne Johnson, take note.Since the first ""Mission,"" which Brian DePalma directed the living daylights out of, the ""Mission: Impossible"" series has been the smart moviegoers' popcorn franchise of choice. (The only dud in the series is John Woo's second installment.)
""Fallout"" the longest ""Mission,"" at just under two and a half hours  not only lives up to its predecessors, but its also one of the best action films in years, and it's still only the third best entry in the series (behind ""4"" and ""1,"" respectively).

As far as movie sequels go, the rule of thumb is that theyre usually no good.Whatever it was we liked about the original, whether it was the action, the laughs, or the scares, is diminished by half.
But the exception to this seems to be Tom CruisesMission: Impossibleseries. With each successive instalment (were now up to six), Cruises Ethan Hunt, who leads the secretive Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team, runs, jumps, dangles, flies and literally does whatever it takes to save the world from the latest baddie threatening to snuff us all out.
The stunts, which have grown increasingly more daring, have seen Cruise scaling tall buildings (M: I 4), holding his breath underwater for over three minutes (M:I 5), hanging on to the side of an A400 plane (M:I 5), climbing up the side of rocky cliffs (M:I 2), leaping off skyscrapers (M:I 3) and much more.
The latest installment Fallout opens today and it features the actor (now 56) engaging in some of the most spectacular action sequences ever to appear on a movie screen.Whether youre a hardcore fan of these films or not, theres more than enough wow factor to leave a lasting impression.
The screenplay, penned byM: I 5writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (who won an Oscar for theUsual Suspectsand is back in the directors chair once again), is standard. A group of evildoers known as the Apostles who are associates of the last movies villain, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), have stolen plutonium to build nukes that will bring death and destruction to some of the worlds holiest cities.
Hunt manages to secure the plutonium at the beginning, but loses it saving one of his IMF teammates, which include the acerbic Luther (Ving Rhames) and the squirrelly Benji (Simon Pegg).
Its now back to square one, and IMF secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) and CIA head Erika Sloane (Angela Bassett) force Hunt to add a new member, Walker (Henry Cavill), to his rescue operation.From there, Hunts reunited with former MI6 ally Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and the mysterious White Widow (The CrownsVanessa Kirby) as he traverses some of Europes most stunning locales (youll immediately want to book a trip to Paris as soon as you walk out of the theatre) trying to stop the missing plutonium from getting into the wrong hands.
Threading this all together is a series of stunts that deserve to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Ive said that in other reviews, but if theres one movie that I think requires you to splurge a little extra for IMAX or something similar, its this one.
First up, the much talked about HALO (high altitude low opening) jump (that Cruise perfected over a hundred tries) that shows Hunt leaping out of a plane and skydiving his way onto the roof of Paris Grand Palais. Thats followed by a brutal bathroom fight alongside Walker.

A truly militant atheist, dedicated to the belief that belief is whats poisoning the world, that faith is what must be expunged if civilization is to be saved? Howinvigorating. Original, even  given the rather anodyne context. But alas. The anti-religious aspect is done away with before the opening credits, and everything proceeds exactly as expected  the switcheroos, the goofy tech, the acrobatic punch-ups, the motorized mayhem, the subdued romantic longing, and oh yes, the bloated indulgence within nearly every set piece. But what of it? Odds are, youll swoon as Cruise plummets through the sky toward the lights of Paris.

Alas. The anti-religious aspect is done away with before the opening credits  though not before an arresting news montage showing the aftermath of nuclear attacks on the Vatican, Jerusalem, and Mecca, and the mad scientists mad claim that, having suffered mutual catastrophes, adherents of Catholicism, Judaism, and Islam will finally be at peace with one another.

But, as the saying goes, it never gets old and thats certainly the case with the sixth installment, Mission: Impossible  Fallout, which isnt the best film in the franchise, but is still breezily entertaining, nonetheless.
This time around, IMF (Impossible Missions Force) master agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is going up against a splinter group of his old foes in The Syndicate and his previous adversary, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). They want to blow up a good part of the world with some compact nuclear devices designed by a scientist (Kristoffer Joner) who has turned to the dark side.After mistakenly letting the bad guys get their hands on the goods, Hunt has to get them back. Meanwhile, IMF rival and suspicious CIA chief, Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), and her brick-wall of an agent, August Walker (Henry Cavill), want to solve the case their way, as does MI:6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) who has her reasons for getting in on the action. Then theres the duplicitous White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) and her gang of Euro henchmen.
So, Hunt and his devoted team  Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames)  are taking incoming threats from all directions as they punch and shoot their way through another set of exotic locales (Paris, London and Kashmir). Directed and written by Christopher McQuarrie, who did the last film, Mission: Impossible  Rogue Nation, Fallout is at its best when it has its pedal to the metal, careening through narrow European byways by car, motorcycle and truck, helicoptering through narrow mountain passes, skydiving through a lightning storm and fighting in a preposterously clean and (mostly) empty bathroom at a French techno club.
The particulars of the story dont matter; exposition is not your friend in a Mission: Impossible movie. McQuarrie knows that and, after an initial blur of information and whos who, he gets down to fight-and-flight basics.
In fact, this is the first time that a director from a previous Impossible film has been called back for duty and he proves this was a wise choice with the aforementioned brawl in the stalls. Cruise, Cavill and stunt performer/actor Liang Yang, as one of the guys theyre pursuing, are electric in this spectacular feat of choreography, a wall-breaking, three-way beatdown of epic proportions. Fans ofThe Raidand similar head-slamming Asian action movies will be impressed.The only problem is the scene is way too short. In a film just shy of two-and-a-half hours, they could have spent a few more minutes going mano a mano in the mens room and the movie would have been none the worse for it.
But thats a minor complaint. Big picture: Cruise once again shows that being 56-years-old is no barrier to being an action hero while the movie itself proves that being a summer blockbuster cash cow that doesnt veer wildly from the unexpected doesnt have to be uninspired.

His mission, and he certainly chose to accept it, was to make this instalment the most action-packed of them all, and so one adrenalized, elaborate set piece follows another, for a bum-numbing two-and-a-half hours, whether there is any logic behind those set pieces or not. I suppose there is a plot threading them together, but Im not sure what it is.The film soon shoves aside coherent storytelling in favor of protracted fights and chases.Its got something to do with three plutonium cores which have been stolen by a band of terrorists called The Apostles. (They are essentially the same terrorists who were called The Syndicate in the previous film, but theyve rebranded themselves and presumably updated their website accordingly.) To get the plutonium back, Ethan has to schmooze a fixer named the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby, ie, Princess Margaret from The Crown), a coolly mischievous femme fatale who deserved a lot more screen time than she gets, and who is no relation to Scarlett Johanssons character in The Avengers.As usual, Hunt is aided and abetted by his two adoring sidekicks, the nervous boffin Benji (Simon Pegg) and the less nervous boffin Luther (Ving Rhames), who provide some amusing odd-couple banter. But the CIAs boss (Angela Bassett) has insisted that Walker tag along, much to the annoyance of Ethans own boss, Hunley (Alec Baldwin). Then theres Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), Ethans old MI6 flame, and Ethans wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan), and Solomon (Sean Harris), the rat-like baddie from the last film. But youd need one of the IMFs amazingly reliable tablets to keep track of whos who, and whose side theyre all on. 
Basically, whenever they get together for a chat, the villains say that the heroes have fallen into a trap, and the heroes reply that, no, the villains have fallen into a trap, and then a villain pulls off a rubber mask to reveal that he is actually a hero, and then everyone agrees that it is time for a shoot-out. Starting off as a glamorously retro European espionage caper, with an undercurrent of doom and a grandiose reference to Homers The Odyssey, the film soon shoves aside coherent storytelling in favour of protracted fights and chases, as Ethan hops from Berlin to Paris to London to Kashmir, perpetually in search of things to climb up, run along, and jump off.Its hard to warm to this invincible robot as much as you might warm to James Bond or Jason Bourne.Its a brawn-over-brain affair. Whereas previous Missions were sometimes about being cleverer than the villains, this one is principally about being tougher and more determined. The main theme is that if you grit your teeth and stare so intently at your target that your eyes almost pop out of your skull, then you can somehow yourself to victory  assuming, of course, you are as indestructible as Ethan. Although he isnt officially a mutant or an alien, he can be thrown off a motorcycle at top speed, with no crash helmet on, and be fit as a fiddle a moment later.
This invulnerability cant help but make Fallout less involving. If you were to judge the film according to the effort that has gone into planning and executing its increasingly spectacular and ludicrous action sequences, you could hail Mission: Impossible  Fallout as a masterpiece (as several critics have). Cruise does his own stunts, and his steely commitment to all the rope-swinging and rooftop-leaping is remarkable, especially bearing in mind that he is now 56, and must have been swigging from the fountain of youth between takes.
But if you judge the film according to how exciting those action sequences are, then Fallout falls short. However technically miraculous a helicopter dogfight or a multi-vehicle heist may be, it cant really get the blood pumping or the sweat flowing if its tone isnt consistent, and McQuarrie keeps wobbling between winking self-parody and apocalyptic seriousness. It cant quite deliver, either, if it doesnt have an interesting villain, or quotable dialogue, or a compelling narrative reason to happen  which brings us back to the parachute jump. More importantly, the impact of these sequences is cushioned by having a hero who isnt a human being.Ethans buddies keep telling us what a good man Ethan is, and McQuarrie gives him some bad dreams to assure us that he has an inner life. But even after six films, its hard to warm to this invincible robot as much as you might warm to James Bond or Jason Bourne. Can you enjoy his knockabout adventures? Definitely. But can you care about them? Impossible.",MH_Doc8_Mission_Impossible_Fallout_Review_Negative,Michael Hesche,Action,Negative,Mission Impossible Fallout

Though it might have made more sense if he tore his Achilles tendon, given that writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, overseer of the priorRogue Nation, begins this arduous blockbuster with the missionshould you choose to accept it tape hidden in a copy of HomersOdyssey.No man aforetime was more blessed, nor shall ever be hereafter is how Odysseus, the wandering protagonist of that ancient Greek epic, describes Achilles, confined to the underworld after his fateful demise by arrow on the Trojan battlefield.Falloutfollows through on at least the first part of Odysseuss sentiment, missing no opportunity to prop up Cruises indomitable earthly ego while his character runs, jumps, falls, fistfights, sky-dives, and clambers up rope and cliff in service ofwhat exactly?McQuarries screenplay posits Hunt as a selfless warrior who believes one innocent person killed is too many. Its this staunch dogma that leads the secret agent, inFallouts pre-credits action sequence, to choose the life of loyal partner Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) over the suitcase of plutonium that a shadowy cabal of terrorists and their shadowier, Dr. Mabuse-like leader require for a nuclear attack on the holy cities of Rome, Jerusalem, and Mecca. At least, thats the initial objective. The particulars of the big, bad master plan begin to shift after a certain cable news anchor makes a clever cameo and a false report. The outcome of this ruse sends the I.M.F. team, which also includes tech nerd Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and gruff, ostensibly by-the-book C.I.A. operative August Walker (Henry Cavill), on a nations-traversing expedition to keep the threatened mushroom clouds at bay.Much of the films action, though, is confined to France and England, all the better to allow Cruise to drive the wrong way through traffic around the Arc de Triomphe or to ascend, monkey-like, the tower of the Tate Modern so he can strike a power pose against the London skyline. Ill figure it out is Hunts oft-repeated mantra in the face of all the purportedly impossible odds. To which the members of his I.M.F. team can only throw up their arms and heave weary sighs as if submissively muttering under their collective breaths, Thats our Ethan! A little of this reverent compliance goes a very long way inFallout, but it gets especially irritating in a late scene in which Stickell delivers a fawning monologue about how unimpeachably wonderful his partner is, as if any doubts to the contrary were equivalent to blasphemy.Stickell is speaking, at that moment, to MI6 operative Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who has her own parallel mission to I.M.F. involving the previous films villain, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Faust was an indelible foil for Hunt inRogue Nation, with her sensuously steely demeanor and gravity-flouting legs of doom. Yet here shes demoted to a neutered cheerleader for hisand, by extension, Cruisesreckless abandon. Yet unlike do-their-own-stunt exemplars such as Buster Keaton and Jackie Chan, theres nothing generous or uplifting about Cruises jaw-dropping exploits. Beneath each potentially bone-crunching feat you sense desperation, a need to prove his physical and mental agility to keep doubt, a dimming star, and death at bay. Its an unseemly display, and its why Cruise tends to work best in films likeWar of the WorldsandEyes Wide Shut, where his vanity is utilized against him, where he exists primarily to be put through a torturous wringer, where he effectively becomes the unwitting butt of a seemingly infinite cosmic joke.You catch a glimmer of that frailty in a close-quarters, bathroom-set fight scene in which Hunt and Walker face off against a roundhouse-kicking, karate-chopping antagonist (Liang Yang). Every time Cruise gets knocked to the floor or through a white-tiled wall, he stumbles to his feet and shoots awhat-the-hell-am-I-doing?glance to the etheror maybe the stunt coordinator. Its the only time the actor betrays anything close to human fallibility, perhaps because the poker-faced Cavill, cocking his super-sized biceps like a pair of double-barreled shotguns, is a stilted cyborg by comparison.As inRogue Nation,Fallouts action scenes are cleanly composed and easy to follow, and so abundant as to become monotonous. Theres barely a second to breathe in between the HALO jumping, the motorcycle crashing, the helicopter ramming, and, in the tedious countdown-clock climax, the frenetic frame-toggling between widescreen 2.39 and IMAX 1.90 aspect ratios. (What Christopher Nolan hath wrought.) It would help if there was a single character worth caring about, though an unintended effect of reducing everyone on screen to a dewy-eyed Tom Cruise booster is that it no longer leaves poor Michelle Monaghan, returning as the incognito Mrs. Ethan Hunt, in the lone thankless role. The real fallout here is that everyones a zero.",MH_Doc9_Mission_Impossible_Fallout_Review_Negative,Michael Hesche,Action,Negative,Mission Impossible Fallout

If there are any 24 fans who have wondered what the TV series might be like if Liam Neeson replaced Kiefer Sutherland, Taken provides an opportunity to have that question answered. Neeson's Bryan Mills uses nearly all the Jack Bauer tactics, including torture, bone-crunching, and bloodletting. He gets involved in car chases, shootouts, and brings a gun to a knife fight. Like the Energizer Bunny, he takes a licking but keeps on ticking. When it comes to action, Taken gets the job done. The film is never boring. It is, however, completely preposterous.

The screenplay, credited to Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, feels like the CliffsNotes version of something longer and more detailed. In order to shoehorn the introduction into a tidy 30-minute package, subtlety is abandoned. There are no transitions, but there's a lot of heavy-handed exposition. The filmmakers' approach is never to use a precision tool when a sledgehammer is available. Credulity isn't high on the list of characteristics they are striving for. The payoff is that once the movie gets going, the ride is enjoyable (if dumb). And one has to accept that, while the ending resolves the film's main storyline, there are countless dangling threads about which we are supposed to forget.

The film introduces us to ex-government operative Bryan Mills and wastes little time showing how competent he is in high-pressure situations when, while working as a hired security guard, he saves the life of a pop starlet (Holly Valance). Meanwhile, Bryan is trying to reconnect with his 17-year old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), but all she really wants from him is a signature on a permission slip so she can spend a few weeks in Paris. Because he ""knows the world"" to be a dangerous place, he's initially reluctant but, after a few nasty stares and cutting remarks from his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), he agrees. The next time he hears from Kim, she's in danger. A group of men have broken into her Paris residence and are stalking her. Armed with little in the way of concrete information, Bryan heads for Europe with the twin goal of finding his daughter and killing those who kidnapped her. The path leads into a maze that includes police corruption, Albanian organized crime, and sex slave trafficking.

On one level, it's refreshing to see people get killed when guns are fired. Hollywood's PG-13 vision is that lots of violence is okay as long at the results of the violence are neutered. It's a little surprising that this movie, with its frank and graphic depictions of torture and unflinching images of death, missed an R. It boggles the mind that the MPAA somehow deemed this appropriate for teenagers but found Slumdog Millionaire too harsh. I feel reasonably sure that five or ten years ago, this cut of Taken would have been rated R. The body count is high - probably at least 20. Jack Bauer would be proud.

This is a French film and most of it takes place in Paris, but as is the case for many projects with which Luc Besson is involved, it was made with an international market in mind. Besson likes to believe he can ""out-Hollywood Hollywood."" So, in this case, there's plenty of action, the stars are internationally known, and the dialogue is primarily in English. Despite these factors, 20th Century Fox hasn't thrown its full weight of approval behind Taken - the movie's release date was pushed back several times, and it reached U.S. theaters only after it was already available on DVD in Europe.

For Liam Neeson, this is one of those ""paycheck"" roles. He's not required to do much more than look grim and participate in some carefully choreographed action sequences. Maggie Grace, still best known for her doomed role in Lost, has the thankless task of playing the victim. There's no single villain, so a bunch of unknowns play various nefarious individuals who bear some degree of responsibility for what has happened to Kim. Unlike in many action films of this sort, however, there's no individual at the top of the totem pole, so Bryan's goal is to eliminate everyone with any degree of involvement. There's no Payback scenario.

Taken has the kind of story that, if fleshed out properly in a novel, might be a page-turner. The perfunctory, contrived manner in which director Pierre Morel handles the material, however, ensures that the movie is never given the opportunity to rise above the level of a cheap potboiler. Like most winter releases, this is one that can be easily bypassed. The well-crafted trailer promises more atmosphere and intelligence than the movie delivers.

I had to adjust my mind a bit before watching ""Taken,"" an action/thriller starring Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills, a retired spy turned domestic bodyguard who gets called back into action when his 17-year-old daughter (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped by Albanian sex traffickers while vacationing in Paris.

My adjustment had nothing to do with the action, which is your fairly straightforward action flick co-written and produced by Luc Besson.

Try to follow me.

""Taken"" co-stars Famke Janssen as Bryan's ex-wife. Janssen starred in last year's festival darling ""Turn the River,"" screened during the Indianapolis International Film Festival alongside this critic's preferred Minnie Driver vehicle, ""Take.""

So, I'm sitting in the theatre watching ""Taken"" thinking ""Where's Minnie Driver?""

Fortunately, there's nothing in ""Taken"" that is anywhere near as confusing.

In fact, if you really give a hoot about logical storylines, character development or plot then ""Taken"" is most likely not for you.

""Taken"" is an action film. Nothing more. Nothing less.

As an action film, ""Taken"" kicks ass. As Bryan Mills, Liam Neeson kicks lots of ass in a wide variety of ways.

Neeson has been in action films before, but there's something a bit tired about ""Taken."" It's sort of along the lines of Harrison Ford's fourth turn as Indiana Jones. Was that fourth Indiana Jones flick horrible? No, not really. It was just wholly unnecessary.

""Taken,"" as action-packed as it is, just feels like an unnecessary cinematic diversion for Neeson.

In other words, ""Taken"" is a paycheck film.

Fans of pure, unadulterated action and/or Besson flicks are likely to find much more to like about ""Taken"" than film critics. By nature, we're a more demanding audience less likely to excuse the storyline, character and plot issues.

Can we get lost in mindless action? Sure. Are we going to write a rave review about it? Probably not, unless it's one of the usual quote whores (You know who you are!).

To the credit of director Pierre Morel, ""Taken"" moves along swiftly and is seldom boring. Morel keeps the action going at a top notch rate, much as he did with the far more enjoyable ""District B13."" At 93 minutes, ""Taken"" is a breezy, mindless, violent and thrilling ride that never makes sense but certainly invades the senses.

Neeson seems well aware that ""Taken"" doesn't require anything resembling acting, and while he occasionally seems to be coasting a bit much it's not nearly as lazy a performance as Michael Caine tends to do in similar situations.

Likewise, Grace and Janssen aren't really called upon to do much but certainly don't do anything to distract from the goings on.

On a weekend when Renee Zellweger tries to distract the romantic audiences away from Superbowl Sunday, it's the hardcore action fans who are likely to be ""Taken.""

Liam Neeson flashes a telltale Harrison Ford smirk a couple of times near the start of Taken, which helps explain why this bracingly effective thriller is getting the January cast-off treatment.

The film has already been released almost everywhere else but North America  it first opened in France last February  and the major critical knock is that it looks like something Ford would have done 20 years ago. Something like Frantic, in fact, the 1988 movie in which Ford's character rousts Paris in search of his kidnapped wife.

The comparisons are apt  Neeson's character rips through Paris for his kidnapped daughter  but you'll miss out on a good movie if you consider Taken just another January dumping.

It's more of a thumping, as Neeson lays bare his action-hero chops. The quiet Irishman doesn't often get a chance to go on an extended tear, but when he does, you need to sit back and watch in amazement.

He's ex-CIA ""preventer"" Bryan Mills, who has recently moved to Los Angeles from Virginia to be more of a dad to his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). His dedication to his job cost him his marriage to Kim's mother, Lenore (Famke Janssen), and he's trying to make up for parental lost time.

Lenore isn't buying it, and she's now happily involved with a tycoon (Xander Berkeley) who is so determined to spoil Kim, he even buys her a pony. It does seem that Bryan is having trouble leaving the rough life behind: he busts a few moves, and heads, while on a freelance protection job for a pop diva (Holly Valance).

Bryan's knuckles and pistols more than come in handy, though, when Kim and her pal Amanda (Katie Cassidy) travel to Paris on vacation, against Bryan's better judgment, and are immediately kidnapped. Bryan learns from his former CIA pals that the girls have been snatched by Albanian pimps, who seek slave prostitutes, and there's a window of no more than 96 hours before the teens disappear into the underworld forever.

A ticking clock within a thriller usually means a bomb is about to go off, and that accurately describes Bryan. To say that he hits the ground running is almost an insult to physics. He is the Tasmanian Devil of trackers. Do not doubt him when he calmly tells the kidnappers, via Kim's purloined cellphone, ""I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you.""

The bodies stack up like jets at a busy airport as Bryan gets down to brutal business, improvising as he goes. Neeson has a marvellously expressive face that contains rage like a bottled tornado. He also conveys the empathy needed for us to endure lots of violence and unfortunate ethnic stereotypes (Arabs are particularly maligned) of this blunt instrument of a film. Who couldn't identify with a father's determination to save his daughter?

Taken is from Luc Besson's genre factory, which explains why France got it first and why it bristles with energy. It also reveals the lineage of Pierre Morel, who capably directed, and Robert Mark Kamen, who co-wrote with Besson. Morel has been the cinematographer for Besson's high-octane The Transporter franchise, and Kamen is Besson's favoured screenwriting partner.

The film's frenetic pace, which really picks up when the action moves to Paris, keeps us from thinking too much about things such as why the Parisian cops ignore Bryan's habit of driving the wrong way on one-way streets. The only gendarme who really pays attention to Bryan, not always for the better, is his old French intelligence comrade Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin).

The choice of Neeson for the lead elevates the material. Time was when Neeson was considered for the role of James Bond.

He would have made good use of the proverbial licence to kill, although 007's lady-killing antics might have been a stretch.

He would also have made a dandy Jason Bourne. At the ripe old age of 56, Neeson retains the physical attributes to arm-wrestle Matt Damon for the role, along with the actor's grace to make us want him to do just that.",MJ_Doc2_Taken_Review_Positive,Mehul Jethva,Action,Positive,Taken

Three self-evident truths emerge from Taken, the lean and brutal thriller about why one should NEVER kidnap a retired secret agent's daughter.

Liam Neeson could have had a helluva career as an action star, had he been willing to sell out.

Secondly, when it comes to action pictures, there are movies that come out under the aegis of Luc Besson (The Professional, La Femme Nikita, The Transporter), and there's everybody else.

And lastly, if we're letting CIA agents this ruthless and tough ""retire,"" then plainly government pensions are entirely too generous.

Taken is about a divorced, doting dad who has quit his job with ""The Agency"" to be closer to his teenage daughter (Maggie Grace). Dad doesn't just dote. He sticks his nose right in Miss Kim's business.

""Mom said your job made you paranoid,"" she sniffs.

""My job made me aware,"" he corrects.

Against his better judgment, he lets the kid, whose mom (Famke Janssen) has re-married and married money, take off for Paris. Sure enough, bad things happen to naive teenage girls abroad.

The kidnapping itself is a drum-tight piece of writing and a brilliant bit of stagecraft. She's on the phone with Dad. Men come into another room and grab her friend. He has just enough time to prepare her, to instruct her on the basics -- ""Focus,"" ""Yell out descriptions of the men"" and hold the phone where he can pick up their voices.

The exclamation point to the scene is Neeson, in a father's righteous, measured fury, telling the kidnappers about his ""very particular skills,"" and how they should let her go and just walk away. They don't. (They never do.) Bad move.

Cinematographer-turned-director Pierre Morel, working from a Besson story (with the master looking over his shoulder during editing, no doubt) transforms the big, burly Irishman into a karate-chopping, derriere-kicking bloodhound, calling on old friends, using his ""particular skills"" to hunt down the kid and those who napped her. Neeson barrels through the screen like a muscle car bouncing anything French, Albanian, American or Arabic out of his way.

The film's brevity means that they only have time to establish the man's affection for his child and his competence. The opening scenes show him bickering with the ex and then joining some ex-colleagues on a pop star security detail and foiling a stalker.

Some moments play as seriously worn out. And as the story resolves itself, a discomfiting French xenophobia and a little CIA torture enters the picture, which won't be to every taste.

But the chases, those fights -- what a rush! Besson didn't re-invent the action film. Still, as Taken re-iterates, Besson's espresso-jag thrillers are all the caffeine an action fan needs until the summer thrill rides arrive.",MJ_Doc3_Taken_Review_Positive,Mehul Jethva,Action,Positive,Taken

Kiefer Sutherland and the producers of 24 keep talking about eventually making a big-screen version of Jack Bauer's daylong, save-the-world adventures.

Someone's beaten them to it. Taken is basically the over-the-top, high-octane world of Bauer with Liam Neeson playing the all-around bad-ass guy. (He even steals a signature Bauer move.)

Only this time, as they say, it's personal.

It's also frequently ridiculous, another trait it shares with 24. But - one more thing in common - it's also fun.

Neeson plays Bryan Mills, who has retired from his job as a CIA ""preventer"" - a shadowy, spy-type gig that took him around the world doing all sorts of top-secret maneuvers but kept him away from his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). Now Mills is trying to make up for lost time, quitting his job to be closer to Kim.

But his former wife (Famke Janssen) has remarried a rich man (Xander Berkeley), who spoils Kim. She wants to go to Paris for the summer with a friend. Mills, who has seen perhaps too much of the bad in the world, doesn't want her to. But his former wife and Kim tag-team him with guilt and accusations of paranoia, so he relents.

And naturally, before she has been in Paris for an hour, Kim and her friend are kidnapped. In fact, the set-up happens ON THE WAY TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE FROM THE AIRPORT. (Those foreign gangsters waste no time.)

This is an especially rough bunch (even the Russians give them a wide berth, we're told), Albanians who addict young women to drugs and either use them as prostitutes or sell them as sex slaves. Mills' intelligence contacts tell him he's got 96 hours to find her (four times as many as Bauer gets) before she's lost forever.

Next thing you know, Mills is in Paris, rooting around the city, turning up leads and killing and maiming people left and right. An old cohort (Olivier Rabourdin) now working behind a desk warns him to lie low, but knows he won't. As the body count grows, Mills makes good on his threats to the kidnappers, often seen in countless airings of the trailer, that he will find them. But can he find Kim?

It's all pretty stupid. Despite a wealth of weapons, including machine guns, no one can seem to bring Mills down. He, on the other hand, has no such trouble. But the action whizzes by so fast - director Pierre Morel keeps the pace pounding - that you don't really notice the absurdity too much until after it's over and you've had time to think about it. Not that Taken encourages much thought. The less thinking you do, in fact, the better.

Neeson is an interesting choice for an action hero, and his straightforward, no-nonsense performance - ""I will find you,"" all that - is enjoyable enough. Mills is certainly not shy about spreading the violence around. You wonder how long it will take Paris to put itself back together after he leaves town.

But that's about all you'll wonder. Taken is movie junk food - fun while it lasts, but not much more. Nothing wrong with that kind of snack every now and then. You just won't want a steady diet of it.",MJ_Doc4_Taken_Review_Positive,Mehul Jethva,Action,Positive,Taken

Without ever taking his shirt off, Liam Neeson makes a surprisingly convincing one-man mean machine in Taken, in which an ex-CIA agent rids Paris of most of its Albanian population while rescuing his darlin teen daughter from nasty white-slave traders. Very much in the style of other non-redemptive Euro shoot-em-ups from Luc Bessons EuropaCorp stable (The Transporter, etc.), dumb, pedal-to-the-metal actioner will sit well with target auds in fast playoff before robust ancillary. Late February release in Gaul has already notched up a warm $4 million in its first two frames; Stateside release via Fox is skedded for September.

Onetime Langley grunt Bryan Mills (Neeson) has moved to Los Angeles to be near his spoiled 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), now embedded in a world of luxury since his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) married rich businessman Stuart (Xander Berkeley). When some ex-CIA pals offer him a nights work bodyguarding a singer (Holly Valance), its clear Bryan has lost none of his Jason Bourne-like skills when he saves the diva from an attempted slaying.

Under pressure from Lenore, Bryan reluctantly agrees to let Kim go on a Euro trip with schoolfriend Amanda (Katie Cassidy). But when both girls are kidnapped by evil Albanians within minutes of their arrival, Bryan hops one of Stuarts private jets to Paris to find her. He reckons he has 96 hours before Kim ends up a drug-addicted lump of white meat.

Besson alum Pierre Morel, who was d.p. on The Transporter and previously helmed 2004s futuristic actioner District B13, wisely doesnt give the viewer any time to ponder the string of unlikely coincidences in the script by Besson and regular scribe Robert Mark Kamen. From the actual kidnapping  breathlessly staged with Kim actually on the phone with dad  to Bryan arriving in Paris and immediately causing a pileup outside the airport, pic has the forward, devil-may-care momentum of a Bond movie on steroids.

With grudging help from former French intelligence op Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin) and an Albanian translator (Goran Kostic), Bryan discovers and then trashes the baddies ramshackle brothel prior to tracking down kidnapper Marko (Arben Bajraktaraj) and his gang. He then learns Kim has been sold in a high-class auction arranged by a certain Patrice St. Clair (Gerard Watkins) for  natch!  Arab clients.

Interventionist politics of the movie, which plays like Rambo in Paris, hardly bear thinking about, but Neeson growls his way through the functional dialogue as an unstoppable killing machine in impressive, cold-eyed style. For a thesp now in his mid-50s, he handles the niftily edited, bone-crunching action way better than his scenes as a sappy, devoted father. Other thesps simply register as evil gun-fodder or script cutouts (including a wasted Janssen), with only Rabourdin suggesting anything like a real character.

Taken is the latest film from the French film-maker Luc Besson and is about American, ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) who turns Paris upside down  Ill tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to!  in his search for his abducted, 17-year-old daughter, Kim, although, personally, I wouldnt have bothered. Kim is so irritating. Kim is so excitable and such a pampered flouncer to boot. Bryan, Id have said to him if I could, youre better off without her; so excitable and such a pampered flouncer to boot. Now, lets go eat. But doting dads are doting dads, I guess, and there is just no stopping him, which is a shame, as what follows is a big sorry mess of the most cliched, improbable and xenophobic kind.  Bryan, Id have also said, I am very hungry and if I dont have supper soon I shall faint. I probably wouldnt have fainted  have yet to faint, ever  but I think Id have tried anything, pulled out all the stops. Still, I wouldnt have added that Id tear down the Eiffel Tower if I had to, as thats just silly.

The film opens in California; happy, sunny California where you are safe because bad, swarthy foreigners cant get to you. Thats the feeling, anyway, and it is weird, I agree. After all, Besson is French and Neeson is Irish but there you have it. There must just be no accounting for pro-American fervour and sentimentalism sometimes, although an eye on the box office must help. Anyway, we are introduced to Bryan: big, tough Bryan who has retired early so he can live nearer to and get closer to Kimmy, who lives with his ex-wife and her husband, Stuart, a zillionaire. Stuart is always outclassing Bryan. Bryan gives Kim a karaoke machine for her 17th birthday. Stuart gives her a pony. Ouch! That clich always hurts. And, boy, does Kim squeal excitedly when she sees that pony. Kim, you are already thinking, deserves whatever is coming to her. Bring it on! Lay her out!

What is coming to Kim? Well, Kim wants to go on a trip to Paris with her friend Amanda, another pampered babe of the flouncing kind, but daddy wont have it. He knows the world and there are bad people out there, he tells Kim. Hells bells, they probably lace the croissants with crack in Paris. Still, he eventually consents with strict warnings about phoning every ten minutes. So Kim and Amanda fly off for what would have been a lovely trip had they not been kidnapped by swarthy, sex-slave traffickers the moment they arrive. Seriously, they dont even get a chance to unpack. Thats how evil Paris is. We know we are in France, by the way, because all the French men carry baguettes, which is always a sign. And they are probably on their way to a game of boules.

Anyway, Bryans not having it, obviously, and yet as he snaps so does everything else: narrative logic; characterisation; believability. When Bryan hooks a girl up to an IV drip in his hotel room, were meant to believe he always travels with an IV drip and bag of saline to hand? When voice recognition software identifies not just what country the kidnapper comes from, but also what village, in about ten seconds, we are meant to believe that, too? Aside from brief intervals of moronic plotting, Taken is mostly just hell-for-leather action sequences: car chases; punch-ups; and Bryan being outnumbered ten to one, yet surviving without so much as a bruise or rent in his suit. The bad guys, by the way, would have been from LA if they hadnt been from Albania.

I cant account for it, really. Besson, as a writer and director, has been behind some perfectly decent films (La Femme Nikita, The Fifth Element) and has also produced quite a number of truly good ones (Nil By Mouth, Tell No One) but this, billed as a taut thriller, is neither taut nor thrilling. Its just nonsense. And as for Neeson, he plays Bryan rather like Daniel Craig as Bond, but without the irony or the Speedos, and we all know how far irony and Speedos can take a film. Truly, this is one to skip. Taken by name but not, alas, by nature, as it doesnt take you anywhere. Forget it.",MJ_Doc6_Taken_Review_Negative,Mehul Jethva,Action,Negative,Taken

If they gave out Oscars for Best Poster and Best Telephone Monologue, ""Taken"" would be the first contender of 2009 in both categories.

If you've seen the trailers or the TV ads, you have already seen the best moment in this film. Speaking on the phone to an unknown bad guy who has kidnapped his daughter, Neeson says, and I quote:

""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you're looking for a ransom, I can tell you, I don't have any money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills acquired over a very long career in the shadows, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you. And I will kill you.""

Yeah baby!

But wait. If you DO have such skills and someone overseas HAS taken your daughter and you ARE going to find him and kill him, do you tell him all that? Unless your goal is to scare him off, which hardly seems likely, why go all Dirty Liam on him?

That quibble is about the 467th most implausible thing about ""Taken,"" an extremely well made and wildly, jaw-droppingly, astonishingly unbelievable thriller from producer Luc Besson, who specializes in this sort of picture. (He directed ""The Professional,"" one of the weirdest and one of the best hitman movies ever made.) Neeson gives this picture more weight than it deserves with a first-rate performance as Bryan Mills, a former CIA operative who has retired so he move to Los Angeles and be near his 17-year-old daughter. Nice timing there, as 17 is just about the age when kids are pining for college and want to spend as little time as possible with their parents.

Maggie Grace is Kim, Famke Janssen is the obligatory ex-wife who keeps reminding Bryan he was NEVER AROUND FOR ANYTHING EVER, and Xander Berkeley is her new husband, an obscenely wealthy guy who gives Kimmy a horse that looks like Secretariat in his prime for her birthday party, which looks like something out of ""The Girls Next Door."" (Clueless Bryan shows up with a cheap karaoke machine.)

Against Bryan's better wishes, Kim and her girlfriend go off to Paris----and within about 45 minutes of their arrival, they've been kidnapped by an evil cabal of Albanians who want to turn them into drug-addicted sex slaves.

From one single recorded phone call with his daughter that transpired as the kidnappers close in on her, Bryan and his CIA friends are able to determine the identities of the kidnappers, the region in Albania where they're from, and much more. He's even told he has just 96 hours to find her, ""or she'll be gone forever."" (Apparently Albanian sex-slave kidnapping rings have a deadline.)

The rest of the film is Bryan tracking down the bad guys and causing mayhem all over Paris. He wrecks cars, he blows up buildings, he kills countless criminals and he uncovers massive corruption in the Paris police department, even as he systematically makes his way to the villain behind the villains. How did the CIA ever let this guy retire? If they'd given him a cell phone, a compass and gun, he could have assassinated Hussein, captured bin Laden and given Kim Jong-il a wedgie in about 30 days.

Talk about a daddy-redemption film. Thanks to this crisis, Bryan goes from pathetic afterthought to Mighty Mouse--""Here I come to saaaaaaave the day!"" There's got to be a part of him that's almost grateful his daughter was kidnapped, just so he can make up for that whole karaoke machine debacle.

There are multiple shootings in this film, and some fairly intense scenes showing young girls who are forcibly addicted to drugs before they're auctioned off like cattle. In one sequence, Bryan casually tortures one of the bad guys. In another, he pulls out a gun and shoots someone you do not expect to be shot. It seems like a completely unnecessary move and makes us wonder if super dad has completely lost it.

With all that violence and all that intensity, ""Taken"" still manages to snare a PG-13 rating. The MPAA is nothing if not consistent. If Maggie Grace (who's 25 and looks way too old to be playing the teen daughter) had done a topless scene, if we had seen more blood, if Bryan had resorted to the f-word, ""Taken"" would have been hit with an R. But this is just slick, loony, escapist violence. No harm in that, right?

Liam Neeson was up forbut never got to playJames Bond, and now hes getting even. In the violent, churning and laughably derivative action bruiser Taken, hes a suave, power-knuckled and once-lethal secret agent named Bryan Mills who, in truth, is just as mean as 007 but maybe slightly more human (hes an ex-husband, as well as a parent who loves his child unconditionally). And hes paid a price for his fists. Bryan once devoted so much concentration and energy to his job as a preventer (I prevented bad things from happening) that his wife (a wasted Famke Janssen, who usually plays these roles herself) left him for a rich California businessman and took their daughter with them. So Bryan retired, moved to Los Angeles to make up for the frayed relationship with his estranged daughter Kim and sacrificed his own career to be near her. All he does now is grill steaks for his buddies and work occasional security jobs like guarding pop stars at rock concerts. But old habits die hard, and Bryan has forgotten none of the special skills he learned from his years with the C.I.A.a knowledge of weapons, wiretaps, deciphering secret codes, scaling buildings like Batman and wiping out anything that gets in his way without regretif he suddenly needs them. When his virginal 17-year-old (huh? In L.A.?) embarks with her girlfriend on a whirlwind tour following the rock group U2 across Europe and, within hours of her arrival in Paris, gets kidnapped by Albanian white slavers, Bryan shifts into demolition mode and takes no prisoners. He may be a has-been, but within 96 hours hes torn down everything in Paris with his bare hands except the Eiffel Tower.

First, he leaves a message on the kidnappers cell phone, which just happens to be lying under the bed where his daughter is hiding: I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you. He does, of course, but not before he slam-dunks his way through the City of Light, turning it into darkness. Equipped with Uzis, knives, swords and even an electric chair, Bryan works without official supervision or an expense account, yet never seems to run out of steam or cash. And there is no limit to his ability to tap international phone lines, spark the ignition in foreign cars without keys and find new ways to torture and kill his victims. In one scene, when he fails to get the right answer from a man strapped to a chair in the middle of a brutal interrogation, he electrocutes him, filling the room with smoke, fire and the smell of burning flesh. Each new victim (including some of Frances leading power players) only piques the simmering rage of a vengeful parent, and we all know that a dangerous secret agent with a mission makes for panic in the streets. Turning the tables on master fiends, police officials and their families, ransacking Paris for clues, Bryan ends up in a shootout on a luxury yacht on the Seine only minutes before Kim is to be raped by an Arab sheik who looks like Jabba the Hutt.

To be generous, its far-fetched to a fault. Worse still, its all been done before. Moving from the theme of vigilante dad (Death Wish), to the strategies of slave traders who traffic girls into prostitution on Internet auctions (Trade), to the tragic spectacle of a scrupulous outsider who slides down the sinkhole of an alternate underworld universe of crime, decadence and perversion (Paul Schraders Hardcore), this hack job has not a shred of originality. Liam Neeson is an unconventional choice to play an action hero. His big, wrinkled smile is at dismaying odds with the lurid mayhem that surrounds him, and how does a brawny American C.I.A. operative account for that lyrical Irish accent? In the end, nobody is called to task for the bodies that litter the streets of Paris, the automobiles and real estate that lie in rubbish left behind or the heroin injections that have mysteriously worn off, leaving Kim heading home to a career as a rock star. Taken is the kind of exploitative junk everyone expects from no-talent French hack Luc Besson, who made the dreadful Transporter films, although this time out hes only the producer and the co-writer of the moronic script, leaving the ossified direction to Pierre Morel. After this horror, you might think twice about sending a teenager to Paris without a chaperone, but it could be worse. She might end up in a movie like Taken.",MJ_Doc8_Taken_Review_Negative,Mehul Jethva,Action,Negative,Taken

NEXT out of the January dreg-u-lator: A Liam Neeson thriller so lacking in ambition they should have called it Paycheck.

Taken, one of those Frenchy efforts to do an American-style chase-em-down and shoot-em-up, comes from formerly respectable producer Luc Besson and director Pierre Morel, whose homegrown, low-budget action thriller District B13 was a lively little collection of stunts. In trying to broaden their scale to interest a big American audience, Besson and Morel are as convincing as Marcel Marceau doing John Wayne.

Neeson plays a retired ex-spook trying to mend fences with the teen daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), he had with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen), who is still bitter about being neglected during his career as an international undercover agent.

We learn that Neesons Bryan left his teammates in the middle of a mission in Beirut so he could fly 9,000 miles to attend one of his daughters birthday parties. So which is it: Was he distant or dedicated? And why do his ex-mates think hes such a great guy if he disappears every time he wants to go wrap a present?

Bryan is a growly killin machine trying to find his daughter after she is kidnapped on a trip to Paris. To find his way, he uses a road map of clichs: moldy dialogue (I will find you. And I will kill you), improbable escapes from teams of incompetent henchmen (just shoot him in the head, guys  dont handcuff him to a loose overhead pipe) and one of those only-in-the-movies sofas that is bulletproof and fluffy at the same time. When the machine guns roar, just get behind one of these babies and watch the air fill with soft, pretty flurries of stuffing. Available at Crate & Gunbarrel.

The movie has two tasks: One is to track Neesons every step as he pieces together the mystery of where his daughter is. The other is to stage cool chases and gunfights. Both the action and the mystery scenes, though, are made up of such choppy, sloppy, laugh-till-you-drop-y elements that I couldnt figure out whether the movie was rushing through the fights to get back to the mystery or vice versa.

An example of how the mystery plays out: Bryan plays a tape of a snippet of conversation between his daughters attackers to one of his fellow spies. The spy tells him that the men are speaking Albanian, identifies what town theyre from, guesses what their game is (trafficking in women to turn into prostitutes) and even explains who their crime boss is.

I wish I had a Basil Exposition of my own to decode Neesons accent. The Irish actor chews over his words as though speaking through a mouthful of mashed potatoes. After half an hour, it dawned on me that he might be trying to sound American, although I couldnt be sure. You need my permission to leave the coontry? he asks.

The fights and chases are so scrambled that its hard to figure out basics such as where objects are in relation to one another. Which of the many white SUVs at the construction site is Bryan driving? Where are the other SUVs? Never mind  what I really want to know is, where do the bad guys get these bullets that, when fired at the driver-side window, shatter the glass but stop before reaching the drivers head?",MJ_Doc9_Taken_Review_Negative,Mehul Jethva,Action,Negative,Taken

Brief Summary: A review of The Martian. This review applauds the ability of the director to make a terrible situation seem lighter. It mentioned Mark Watneys quick and witty instincts to allow him to survive what is a seemingly endless train of issues and obstacles.


The Martian, is a movie you should be stoked about, and it ranks among the year's, and the directors best.
 
Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is part of the first ever manned mission to Mars, and when a freak storm causes the team to abandon the planet, he is going to be the first person to die there. An accident causes him to be left behind, presumed dead by his team, stranded on the surface of the Red Planet. With resources limited and time running out, Mark has to find a way to survive where every single move is life and death. So, no pressure or anything.
 
The Martian could very easily have bogged down in hopelessness and despair, but the remarkable thing, which sets it apart from so many other films, is that it remains stubbornly optimistic. While fear and desolation do creep in at the edges, the film is all about staying positive in the face of overwhelming adversity and straight up MacGuyvering your way through each and every problem. Mark faces mind-boggling challengeshes short on food and water, his shelter is only designed for a short stint, and none of it matters if he cant find a way to communicate with NASA anywayand he tackles each one at a time.
 
Start with one problem, find a solution, and move on to the next, and so and so forth until theyre all taken care of. The Martian is a celebration of science and intellect. Mark Watney may be an astronaut, but hes not your typical action hero; he uses brains instead of brawn, and hes sure to become a cinematic icon for the scientifically inclined everywherehe gets by on instinct, training, and intelligence.
 
 
 
Above all else, The Martian is a masterfully executed balancing act in almost every regard. For a movie primarily about a man alone on Mars, a futuristic Robinson Crusoe struggling to survive, its surprisingly funny. But this humor itself is a number of different things and the meaning evolves over time. By turns its a personality trait, a celebration of small victories, a defense mechanism in the face of defeat, and even desperation. Sometimes you laugh with Watney, others his laughter almost makes you weep, and Damon walks this line flawlessly, convincing himself as he convinces the viewer.
 
Though The Martian is one disaster after another, the script, adapted by Cabin in the Woods director Drew Goddard from the novel by Andy Weir, never feels like its simply dumping endless shit on top of Watney. In a setting where in every action, no matter how minor, his life is literally on the line, thats simply the reality of the situation, and Mark never takes it personally, never gives in to the temptation to curl up, cry what me, or give up. Its a constant barrage of tension, not heaping piles of abuse.
 
This balance also extends beyond what goes down on the surface of Mars. The film frequently cuts away to the team at NASA, first as they attempt to come to terms with losing a man, and then, after they learn he is alive, as they attempt to bring him home. I was initially worried about these scenes because as you watch, youre so invested in Marks story and you want to stay with him, that this feels like a distraction, like it will impinge on the main narrative thrust. Fortunately, Scott and Goddard keep these moments quick and punchy. They get in, do what they need, and get out, and it doesnt hurt that they are filled with fantastic actors like Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kristen Wiig, Donald Glover, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kate Mara, and more.
 
Theres never been a question about whether or not Ridley Scott has visual chops as a director, but theyre taken to the next level here, and The Martian is a movie that begs to be seen in 3D. The stunning panoramas of Mars give the film an almost western frontier vibe, and even though he uses a number of devices like Watney keeping a video dialoguea clever way to dump a ton of technical information on the audience without it feeling oppressiveand cameras mounted on the survival habitat and rover, actually add interesting elements instead of coming across as obnoxious intrusions as they easily could have.
 
The Martian is many things: an epic space adventure, a story of one mans determination, fighting for survival in the most hostile environment imaginable, an effects-driven tentpole, a small human story, and much more. You can enjoy it if youre looking for spectacle and action, for drama and emotion, and anything in between. Whatever youre in the mood for, The Martian will likely deliver. And theres an ABBA song (the Bowie is a bit too easy), whats not to love? [Grade: A]",PWD-Doc5_Martian-Review,Parker Davis ,Science Fiction ,Positive ,The Martian

Brief Summary: A review of The Martian. The jokes are overused and unfunny. Talks about how the people at NASA just cheerleading instead of helping. Thinks that the movie is all long-shots with no actual deserved wins. 


Matt Damon has lately spent so much onscreen time in space that one begins to worry about how hell reacclimatize to earthbound roles. He dodged flamboyant explosions to infiltrate a posh space station in Neill Blomkamps 2013 Elysium, and last year (in an uncredited maxi-cameo) harbored a confusing hidden agenda as the only inhabitant of an uninhabitable planet in Christopher Nolans Interstellar. His latest movie, The Martian, strands him on the more accessible but no less unfriendly intra-galaxy terrain of the Red Planet, his fellow crew having up and left, presuming him dead after his bio-monitor goes kaput during a sandstorm. This plucky ensemble action movie, the moral of which is that youre in trouble if youre not troubleshooting, comes courtesy of perennial studio trustee Ridley Scott, himself not far removed from the Alien quasi-prequel Prometheus, a space opera that was bathed in a beautiful blue celestial light, and afflicted with an absolutely jaw-dropping attention deficit. (Sequels to the prequel in the pipe.)
Adapted from Andy Weirs novel by Cabin in the Woods writer-director Drew Goddard, The Martian is an appreciably more involving and resourceful film than Prometheusfor a time its fun to watch Damons character, enthusiastically wise-cracking botanist Mark Watney, science the shit out of a host of problems, creating water out of a combustible chemistry-lab setup, deriving vital warmth from decaying plutonium, and so on. The tone, however, soon grows annoyingly flip, as the near-future sci-fi conjures up the recent past. Rather than any more enduring examples of the genre, The Martian perhaps most closely resembles the heedless pyrotechnics of the Bruckheimer back catalogueparticularly Michael Bays 1998 Armageddon, with its NASA cheerleading and proudly dumb (and entirely unmodulated) comic relief. Watneys running commentary on the awfulness of discothe only music he has access to, a cache of instantly recognizable hit singles having been left behind by mission commander Jessica Chastainhas to be one of the most beat-to-death jokes in recent cinema. In a suite of scenes that mostly serve to take this otherwise efficient movie off course, Donald Glover appears as an (ostensibly lovably hapless) on-the-spectrum astrophysicist, rubbing his superiorsand any viewers wary of such deep-dish clichsthe wrong way.
NASAfronted here by Jeff Daniels, whose war room also hosts Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kristen Wiig, and Sean Beaneventually catches on that Watneys still alive, and Scott does instill a sense of urgency to the constant timetable revising that ensues once the parties establish contact: how soon can a rescue mission blast off, and how long can Watney subsist on his Turin Horse ration of boiled potatoes? As pure numbers-game suspense, the movie passes inspection, but the relative absence of soul searching, particularly by the protagonist, makes it seem a specious vehicle for the trumpeting of such human (well, substantially American) values as cooperation, perseverance, and self-sacrifice. The story depends on long-shot odds, but nothing here actually feels hard-won. Watney does break down a few times in end-of-the-road frustration, but the height of solitude doesnt otherwise seem to faze him muchtheres not much desperation to his survive-at-all-costs determination. Mostly hes content to deliver upbeat TV-host-style explanations of his spacehackspretty clever, he has to admitinto his home bases video log, the content of which would take so long to transmit to Earth that he treats the camera like a companion, if not a confessor. In space, no one can hear you humblebrag. You can feel free to be a little bit insufferable.",PWD_Doc10_Martian-Review,Parker Davis ,Science Fiction ,Negative,The Martian

Brief Summary: A review of The Martian. The review describes the thrilling shots of Mars with the movie showcasing the ability of people to persevere through incredibly difficult challenges. 


Everywhere I go, Im the first, astronaut Mark Watney says in The Martian after he has been presumed dead and abandoned on the planet by his crew following a storm. Maybe thats part of the appeal of this 2015 movie, directed by Ridley Scott and based on the novel by Andy Weir. Much of the film is focused on one mans survival on an empty planet and theres a sense of grandiosity in everything he does, even planting potatoes, though its mixed with an unexpected amount of humor that keeps it from feeling pretentious.


The Martian follows astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) who is separated from his crew during a storm and presumed dead. The rest of the team, led by commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), leaves without him despite their guilt. However, Watney is injured, but alive and has to figure out ways to stretch his resources to last until another shuttle can reach him and a way to contact the NASA center to let them know hes there. The movie shifts between Watneys fight for survival, the crew (including Michael Pena, Kate Mara, and Sebastian Stan) out in space, and the NASA center where Director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) has some difficult decisions to make as the public watches eagerly. 


A great screenplay is aided by the gorgeous and intricate production design, creating impressive shots of the Mars landscape. From the intense and chaotic storm to the eerie peacefulness of the land Watney wakes to, even the first fifteen minutes of this film are impressive. The spaceships themselves also feature cool design and some awesome gravity effects. Certainly, its not wildly different from other space movies that have been released in the decade, but the landscape of Mars is refreshingly different from the normal moon scenery shown. 


For a film that wastes no time in its opening, jumping straight to the storm which results in Watney being left behind, it does slow down in the middle to a point of dragging. The scenes on Earth are considerably less compelling than those in space making the two hours and twenty minutes runtime apparent. One bright spot in these scenes is Donald Glover as astrodynamics scientist Rich Purnell who brings his usual charm to the role. 


The entire ensemble of the cast elevates this movie and characters that could seem one-dimensional or underdeveloped are saved by lovely performances. Jessica Chastain is certainly one of the most reliable actresses working today and while her performance is understated, and perhaps the role could have been expanded, she helps ground the film. In fact, the sense of community amongst all of the astronaut crew is one of the best things about The Martian. This role brought Matt Damon his third Academy Award nomination for acting and he is phenomenal in it. His work is more of an actual performance than his previous roles have often required from him, as he has mostly relied on his movie-star charm and looks. His acting in the first fifteen minutes of the film, from the storm, to discovering he is alone on Mars, to treating his own injury are easily some of the best he's ever put forward. 


One thing that sets this movie aside from other space travel movies is the amount of humor in Watneys character. Much of his parts are shot in a vlog-like style as he logs videos about his time on Mars. This allows him to humorously narrate his actions -- from silly mistakes in calculations to his frustration over running out of ketchup. Its also a clever ploy to give him a reason for dialogue despite being on a planet alone. 


One of the funniest aspects is his ongoing frustration with the fact that the only music he has access to is Commander Lewiss 1970s disco music. This music provides the movie with an amazing soundtrack with everything from Donna Summers Hot Stuff to ABBAs Waterloo. (Come on, Watney, what do you have to complain about?) This music is supplemented with a great score by Harry Gregson-Williams. The sound design of the movie is also good, from the storms and wind to the effect of astronauts being able to hear their own breathing in their helmet. 


Admittedly, space travel movies are not normally my thing, but this one blew me away. It is at its best in its scenes in outer space, whether with Mark Watney himself or the rest of the astronauts. It seems to understand that the quotidian of life in space as a lone man attempts to survive is as fascinating as any storm or explosion. The Martian is an ode to the power of science, the power of the human will to survive, and the power of hope.",PWD_Doc1_Martian-Review,Parker Davis ,Science Fiction ,Positive ,The Martian

Brief Summary: A review of The Martian. Talks about how everyone believed the Martian to be dead, and outlined the problem solving involved in saving him. Talks about how the movie was able to make light of some grave situations and how people are capable of surviving a lot




Director Ridley Scott has gone through a lot of highs and lows (mostly lows) over the last 10 years. In 2010, his version of Robin Hood was met with contempt and in 2012, Prometheus divided audiences and critics alike. It seems that Scott wasnt connecting with audiences like he used to with movies like Alien, Gladiator, and Black Hawk Down, but his latest film, The Martian, gives a lot of reasons to fall in love with the 77-year-old director again.
The Martian follows Ares III, a manned mission to Mars. Its mission is cut short when a terrible Martian storm threatens their stint on the Red Planet. During their escape, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is terribly injured and left for dead. Surprisingly, Watney managed to survive the storm but is stranded on Mars with only a month of supplies and four years before another mission can come back. With the crew of The Hermes, Ares IIIs primary shuttle, and the world believing hes dead, Watney must figure out a way to grow food, find water, and communicate back to Earth.
With a running time of 141 minutes, The Martian surprisingly moves at a steady, brisk, and engaging pace. The film puts its audience along with Watney as he uses science and math to problem solve his way out of Mars. Throughout the film, Watney keeps his sense of humor to keep his spirits and mind together, as The Martian goes for a lighter tone for a survival story.
Its actually quite refreshing and, dare I say, fun. Its strange to say that a movie about a person trying to survive on a distant planet for years and years is fun but Ridley Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard pull it off and successfully sell it to an audience. A lot of the films personality comes from Matt Damons natural movie star charm but his real accomplishment in the film is injecting the character with humanity. It would be easy for Mark Watney to come off as a superhero of science but the real success comes from trial and error and never giving up.
The Martian also features a subplot with the crew of The Hermes and NASA on Earth. NASA figures out that Watney is still alive when routine satellite imaging suggests that something is moving on the Red Planet. Now that NASA figured out that hes still alive on Mars, they have to come up with a way to bring him back home safely. While NASA butts heads with each other trying to think of the best way to save him, the rest of the world sits and waits for a viable rescue plan. Once that is achieved, they inform Watneys old crew, who are on their way back to Earth, that hes still alive on Mars. They have to decide to either go home or go back to the Red Planet to save him.
Ridley Scott does a fine job juggling the films storylines, making them clear enough to follow so an audience doesnt get lost with space and science mumbo jumbo. The Martian focuses on the human elements of survival and rescue instead of a cold and overly intellectual approach, which is why it succeeds instead of other recent science fiction survival stories, such as Christopher Nolans Interstellar and Alfonso Cuarns Gravity.
The Martian is exactly the reason why we watch movies. Its fun, exciting, and a thrilling spectacle with deep emotional payoffs and strong performances from its all-star cast. Its a movie about the world coming together to solve a problem rather than endlessly arguing and I think thats something we can all get behind.",PWD_Doc2_Martian-Review,Parker Davis ,Science Fiction ,Positive ,The Martian

Brief Summary: A review of The Martian. Review talking about how the director is able to make the situation seem breezy compared to its tense nature. Questions the reader how they would respond in a similar situation. Applauds the creativity and scientific approaches used


If you were stuck on Mars, would you have the knowledge and the wherewithal to survive months, weeks, days, or even hours? In The Martian, a botanist finds himself trapped on the red planet where he must hope that rescue will come before his ability to survive runs its course.
Matt Damon stars as Mark Watney, a member of a small crew sent to Mars to expand their understanding of the environment of the planet and attempt to create a sustainable outpost for future exploration. When a sudden dust storm threatens to topple their only means of escape, the team attempts to flee the planet before its too late, escaping just in the nick of time, but abandoning Watney planetside.
With little hope of rescue, Watney attempts to use science to his advantage and find a way to survive as long as possible, not knowing for sure if anyone will come to his aid. Finding a way to generate water on the dusty, barren planet provides one of his earliest challenges, but he tries countless times to perfect the method and eventually succeeds.
Set in the not-so-distant future, this science-heavy drama with comedic accents gives Damon his most engaging and charming vehicle yet. Watney isnt perfect, as no scientist is, and experimentation is every bit as important as knowledge, but his myriad successes and failures give insight into the scientific method while engaging and entertaining the audience in vastly compelling ways.
Some periphery performances bear some scrutiny, but the cast is largely superb as an array of thoughtful, intelligent men and women break barriers, explore solutions, and showcase why many of us got so interested in science, especially space sciences, as children. The intense, impactful screenplay by Drew Goddard, based on the book by Andy Weir, gives the various performers plenty to work with as they create a tapestry of performances that urge the audiences emotional investment.
Director Ridley Scott infuses excitement and intrigue into a premise thats stretched to two-and-a-half hours, but feels like its much breezier. His ability to create tension, perfected three decades earlier, has been honed to great success in a feature that acts as more of an exception in his latter career than as an example.
This is the Scott many of us have been longing to rediscover since he became mired in a sea of films of dubious and intermittent quality. His last widely productive period of high quality output ended with 1991s Thelma & Louise and has been wildly inconsistent since then with more failures than successes in the interim.
Whether or not The Martian marks a successful return to form for Scott or not, it remains a highly engaging feature that deserves attention regardless of its directors surrounding misadventures. Damon is more accessible than hes ever been, proving a fitting everyman through which to frame this science-laden and involving film.",PWD_Doc3_Martian-Review,Parker Davis ,Science Fiction ,Positive ,The Martian

Brief Summary: A review of The Martian. Talking about how Mark Watney was left by his crew. He was required to use his special skill sets to survive. Talked about the challenge of living under total isolation for so long. Mentioned real life not being ready yet to send manned missions to mars. 




Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and her crew of astronauts, including Mark Watney (Matt Damon), Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan), Rick Martinez (Michael Pena), and Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie), have reached the final day of the Ares III Mars mission. But when an unexpected storm hits their shuttle, and Watney is knocked clear of the launch site by debris, the group is forced to make a hasty departure back into orbit. Presumed dead, Watney is left stranded alone on Mars with little hope for rescue or survival. Unable to communicate with his colleagues or NASA, the lone spaceman must rely on science and his own ingenuity to devise a way to sustain himself on a planet devoid of all life.
An initial, severe tempest provides chaotic moments for The Martian to radiate an Alien/Prometheus vibe before the suitcam and dashcam found-footage sequences begin to cheapen the visuals (almost as if director Ridley Scott wanted to try his hand at the tired technique). Fortunately, theyre interspersed with standard cinematography, plenty of suspense (which Scott handles admirably), and even a moment of grisly, impromptu surgery (the kind of brief, visceral violence the director never shies away from). The focus on dwindling food, water (and its manufacturing when all of the research equipment is flame retardant), and oxygen, potential breaches in shelter, and communication deficiencies tend to save the picture from gimmicky digressions. Perhaps the greatest challenge could have been the extreme isolation and its effects on the psyche, though this is almost altogether ignored.
Strangely, the overall look of the project is largely conflicting; the technology used on Mars and for the Hermes transport resembles believable concepts for current space travel (or a science-fact motif), while the NASA facilities and other earthbound locations appear just as grounded in the present. But the technological advancements necessary for sending a manned crew to the red planet are so far into the future that certainly there would be robots or drones or driverless vehicles roaming about on Earth. In other words, the only concept that seems excessively futuristic is the setting of Mars itself. If this whole adventure had been based on a moon mission, there would be no conceptual discord.
As for the story, Drew Goddards script (from the book by Andy Weir) attempts to work too many narratives and an excess of characters into the exhausting running time. Watneys ordeals are fascinating and thrilling as he utilizes science and his special skillset to overcome continuous  but never contrived  obstacles, which generate plenty of humor and several triumphant scenarios. A second plot intrudes into the timeline, featuring Lewis and her crew planning a daring rescue mission, which is circuitous yet generally necessary. But when a third viewpoint (NASAs mission control center) butts into the already stuffed screenplay, the pacing drastically suffers. This completely unnecessary smattering of bureaucratic employees (most having so little to do that their jobs are never specifically detailed) adds nothing but political maneuverings, international teamwork (itself containing even more factions of pointless supporting characters), and public relations issues, which strive to slow down the momentum. The constructing of a probe, the orchestrations of launches, and the negotiations over information and timetables are excruciatingly unwanted.
Theres also a bit of heavy-handed interplay among crewmembers and coworkers that creates disappointing sentimentality. At least, when the bits of suspense arrive (mostly dealing with a lone survivalist doing inspirational things), theyre handled with Scotts veteran expertise and Damons sensational screen presence. And, despite a coincidentally familiar cast and a theme of harrowing cosmonautical misadventures, the film manages not to be anything like Interstellar 2.",PWD_Doc4_Martian-Review,Parker Davis ,Science Fiction ,Positive ,The Martian

Brief Summary: A review of The Martian. Describes the movie as a bit ridiculous. Talks about the effort to get back to Mark Watney. Talks about how a book was originally written and the movie is different from it. Mentions the unlikeliness of survival.


Veteran director Ridley Scotts science fiction film The Martian is based on the 2011 novel by American author Andy Weir. In the movies opening scene the crew of the Ares III manned mission to Mars is forced to abandon their plans and leave the planet when a severe, hurricane-like sandstorm descends on them. Unavoidably left behind is crew member Mark Watney (Matt Damon), presumed to be dead after being struck by communications equipment and separated from the others during the storm.
Watney, in fact, survives the disaster and is able to treat his injuries. He finds the living and working quarters the crew had set up (the Hab) intact and has enough food for several hundred Martian days, or sols (each sol is some 24 hours, 40 minutes). However, he is alone on the desolate planet, tens of millions of kilometers from home. Watney has no means of communicating with Earth, because of the destruction of the communication gear in the tempest, and the next manned mission is not scheduled for another four years. How can he survive that long and how can he travel to the location of that missions landing, some 3,200 kilometers away?
A botanist (and a mechanical engineer, at least in the Weir novel), Watney sets about solving his various problems. He grows potatoes inside the habitats artificial environment and begins to modify his only vehicle, a rover, to make possible much longer trips.
The scientific-technical challenges and solutions are interesting, occasionally fascinating: Watneys agricultural experiments, his discovery of a method to create water, his transformation of his rover vehicle, his retrieval of the Pathfinder probe and his re-establishing of communication with Earth, NASAs various rescue plans, the final effort to intercept him in space. (The decision to paint the Chinese space program and officials in a positive light, given current US government policies, has to be considered almost an act of bravery.)
Unfortunately, when the film goes beyond the limits of depicting those practical tasks, it falters badly. One of the considerable difficulties The Martian faces is its literary-intellectual source. Weir, the son of an accelerator physicist and an electrical engineer, is a capable organizer-summarizer of materials and problems, and apparently knows his science (according to various publications), but he is not an artistically gifted writer.
It is hard to believe that any human being could go through the terrifying and life-altering experiences Weir describes and remain so unrelentingly shallow. The various astronauts and cosmonauts to date may not have always been the most articulate or cultured individuals, but one has the impression that they responded with considerable seriousness to the immensity of space and the significance of their own activities.
Why the heavy-handed humor in the original novel? Perhaps Weir felt that only through such an approach could he make the medicine go down, i.e., render palatable to the public a complex story about the science of space travel and space survival. If that is the case, then he underestimated his audience.
Perhaps more to the point, the contrast between the remarkable scientific achievements, on the one hand, and the unserious depiction of the human interactions, on the other, speaks to an American malaise at present: technological abundance combined with a terrible cultural and intellectual deficiency.
In any event, Scotts new film portrays a manned mission to Mars some time in the not too distant future. Science fiction indeed! No critic or anyone involved in the production has referred to the fact that the US shut down its manned space effort in 2011 for an indefinite period of time, thanks in large part to budget cuts, an event, as the WSWS noted at the time, of considerable historical significance.


The Christian Science Monitor, in July 2014, asked: Will the US ever have [a] manned space program again? The article noted that with its Space Launch System, a rocket system designed for launches into deep space, NASA hopes to take a giant leap into deep space, but the US Government Accountability Office says that the space agency may not have enough money. According to a GAO estimate released Wednesday, NASA may be $400 million short to complete the project. Billions and billions for the destruction of peoples and societies around the world, but not hundreds of millions for the exploration of space.",PWD_Doc6_Martian-Review,Parker Davis ,Science Fiction ,Negative,The Martian

Brief Summary: A review of The Martian. Says the movie has a pedestrian approach to the problems. Says it lacks excitement. Mentions that the script might not be the best and it takes away from the despair that we should feel towards Mark Watney 


We love stories of survival against all odds. Like a boy trapped in a well or the Chilean miners imprisoned in the bowels of the earth, there is something transcendent about the persistence of the human spirit in situations of grave peril. It unites us, breaks down partisan politics and ideological divides. In 1970, the country watched riveted as the lives of the men piloting Apollo 13 hung in the balance as NASA tried to bring the craft home. Ron Howard went on to direct a successful adaptation of the fateful mission, a ripped from the headlines tale that featured Tom Hanks recreating the perilous few days where it looked like astronaut James A. Lovell and his crew might not make it back to Earth alive.
In this vein, Ridley Scotts adaptation of The Martian, Andy Weirs 2011 novel, already has a successful pedigree as the director tells the story of an astronaut stranded on the red planet and the men and women who work to bring him back. As Mark Watney (Matt Damon) relies on ingenuity to keep himself alive despite lacking in food and oxygen, the folks at NASA also must figure out how to get him off Mars. This is an old fashioned survival tale gussied up with some cool special effects. But The Martian lacks the gut-punch excitement of Gravity (though boasting a much better script) and the ambition and awe of Interstellar, leaving the film in serviceable limbo where it could have really soared.
Adapted by Drew Goddard, The Martian doesnt take itself as seriously as Apollo 13. Comic moments pepper the film, including Watneys own self-aware video diary that he keeps in case he is never rescued. This is some pretty heavy shit, but Goddard lightens the despair with a punchy script that allows Damon to fall back on his charms as the stranded astronaut. It makes sense, especially since his actual chances of survival are quite slim. How miserable would it have been to spend two hours with a character lamenting his fate as he slowly runs out of sustenance and other materials?
But that glibness also detracts from emotionality, giving the entire film a glossy, dejected air that only gives perfunctory credence to the plight and feelings of its characters. Also, Goddard spends a lot of time concentrating on the science that both Watney and NASA use in their respective survival and rescue attempts. This is just fine, but he also inadvertently alienates audience members by both relying too much on hard science and then dumbing it down to appeal to wider audience. So who wins in this sort of situation? No one. Living on Mars or in a space craft has its struggles, but were too distracted by the conventionalities of the script to really experience the struggle.
Being rooted in reality does have its benefits. There are no aliens here, and all the peril is possible in outer space as we know it. Scott hasnt made a good film in years and by being merely solid, The Martian may well be his best in a long time. Damon also does well as Watney, but the role really isnt a stretch for him. The film is padded with a bevy of recognizable faces, from Jeff Daniels as the grimly embattled head of NASA to Jessica Chastain as Watneys mission commander. Only Kristen Wiig feels horribly miscast as some NASA suit whose job description is nebulous.
For a film thats set on Mars, The Martian is fairly pedestrian. Visiting a neighboring planet should be exciting, but things often toe a flat line. Watney may be taking a bunch of giant steps for mankind, but The Martian merely tiptoes around other great films that take on a similar topic.",PWD_Doc7_Martian-Review,Parker Davis ,Science Fiction ,Negative,The Martian

Brief Summary: A review of The Martian. Describes it as boring and predictable. Mentions the plot of an astronaut being abandoned which has been similar to other movies in the past. The setting didn't look like Mars at all. 


After a manned mission on Mars encounters a horrific dust storm and goes significantly haywire, the crew of the Ares 3 are forced into an emergency evacuation. Believing him dead, crew botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left behind. Forced to find a way to survive, Watney uses science to solve unimaginable problems in order to stave off certain death until a NASA crew, millions of miles away, can return to save him  in four years.
As you would expect from that description, The Martian is essentially Castaway in Space. Only instead of volleyball besties and leafy loin clothes, our hero is forced to Science the shit out of this for his very survival. Much has been made of the scientific accuracy in The Martian, and it sure does seem mighty impressive to this dumdum. From using human feces as fertilizer in order to grow potato crops, to restoring power and oxygen, and even utilizing moisture and recycling for water. The science involved is very extensive and I was completely fascinated with the various applications Watney was able to utilize to stay alive. It also made me realize how much I need to catch up on my Neil deGrasse Tyson articles (be sure to check out our interview with Mr. Tyson from last year).
But it sure does not make for an entertaining movie. These are the hardest reviews to write  and not just due to the hate mail destined to flood my inbox  because this is not a poorly crafted film. Matt Damon, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, and Chiwetel Ejiofor acted the shit out of this thing. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski has moments of astonishing beauty (and others where it just looks like Arizona through a red filtered lens). Unfortunately the story is exhaustingly predictable, there are way too many convenient solutions, and ultimately the film is just waytoolong.
No, I dont mean we need action beats every 15 seconds. This is a survival story and thats how it should be told. While science buffs the world over are praising the numerous truths at play here, they seem to blatantly ignore how every item Watney needs to use such science is conveniently located on the planet (I wont spoil them here, but there are several). Its almost comical how every problem had a solution that required a specific item that just HAPPENED to already be on Mars. Turns out Watney should just calm down, NASA is the flipping Boy Scouts of government organizations and they have everything covered. Dont even get me started on how eye-rolling it is to have a real-time news broadcast of an event millions of miles away. Even a 3rd grader understands thats some wonky science right there.


All of that I could overlook as movie magic if The Martian didnt commit the biggest movie crime of all  I just didnt care. Damon is one of our greatest actors and he does everything in his arsenal to keep us engaged, but after the first 90 minutes, I started hoping his potatoes would spoil. Castaway kept us engaged because we felt every inch of how despondent and desperate Tom Hanks was as he sat on the beach yelling at his volleyball. Damons Watney spends more time joking and mocking than convincing us he could die at any second. Until the final reel, I had very little attachment to Watneys plight because he rarely seemed to grasp the absolute severity of the situation. Jovial and charming have their place, but I doubt its so prominent when youre stranded on a barren planet eating veggies grown in your own excrement.
Should we spend billions back on Earth to save one man? Should other astronauts risk their lives in the process? Would this science really work? Could a man actually survive on a distant planet for years with only his wits to save him? These are all of the questions we should be asking, and by the end of The Martian, I just didnt give a damn about any of them. My only answer was  Did the credits roll yet? At one point I almost left to buy a watch, just so I could look at it.
The Martian is a finely shot, extremely well-acted film that is so by-the-numbers I hope to never see it again. In fact, I think Id rather be stranded on Mars.",PWD_Doc8_Martian-Review,Parker Davis ,Science Fiction ,Negative,The Martian

Brief Summary: A review of The Martian. The movie is too technical and too much science jargon is used. Doesnt think Mark Watney properly conveys his despair of being stranded alone on Mars. Talks about the impracticality of saving him.




Is there life on Mars? Perhaps, but what we do know is that theres certainly water.
No Hollywood studio in the world could choreograph a publicity stunt quite like it: on the opening week of The Martian, NASA discovers that there is indeed life-giving water on Mars. High fives all round, and the marketing department can take a well-deserved break.
But to be fair, The Martian sorely needed a publicity boost like this; without it, the film was careening its way towards a much sorrier fate.
The story goes as follows: after being left for dead on Mars by his comrades after a mission goes a bit awry, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) finds himself living on Mars, alone and with a finite supply of food.
As luck would have it, Watney is a botanist, and as he reminds himself and us after growing a crop of potatoes on the hostile Martian terrain, the finest botanist on the planet.
Meanwhile, the boffins down at NASAs headquarters in Texas  and by god, are they boffins  have realised the crews mistake, and are on a mission to save their guy.
The main problem? It takes about four years to reach the planet from Texas. Its all highly reminiscent of the Tom Hanks vehicle Cast Away, in which a man was left to his own devices, presumed dead, on a remote island.
So far, so intriguing, and with Ridley Scott in the directors chair, a rollicking good time is all but guaranteed, right? Eh, wrong.
Certainly, The Martian looks lavish, as one might expect from Scott, who is the grand don of sci-fi. And while theres no arguing with Damons movie-star credentials, he doesnt carry the film in quite the same way as Tom Hanks did with Cast Away.
Watney is the fulcrum of the film, and sadly, the writers of The Martian (Drew Goddard and Andy Weir) havent fleshed out the character of Watney fully enough for us to be stuck with him for much of the movie.
Certainly, he comes out with some witty one-liners to his video log (potatoes with Vicodin for dinner. I ran out of ketchup this week), but theres no backstory, no interiority, and no look at the psychological ramifications of being alone in space for months on end.
He grows a beard and drops a few pounds; other than that, it seems as though Watney might be perfectly content to spend eternity in the ether once he had grub.
Theres plenty of scrimping, too, when it comes to using his comrades (played by a stellar list, among them Jessica Chastain and Rooney Mara). 
Theyre all criminally underplayed and under-explored: Chastains character Lewis likes disco music, and thats as far as we get with her. That theres no sniff of a love interest or a family for Watney is a nicely skewed clich, but this would have helped to get some meat on this otherwise paltry tale. Similarly, any efforts at tension, like Watneys spuds coming a cropper, come to very little.
What we do get is a lot of science; in fact, were clobbered about the head with quantum physics and other technological jargon, constantly. Everyone sounds very clever and committed to their work its just such a shame theyre all so boring.
If youre a sci-fi nerd, there is plenty to like in The Martian. As Watney says, he will survive his time on Mars if he can science the sh** out of this. Sadly, youll feel every bit as scienced out.
Its the nearest most of us will get to feeling like weve lived on Mars for an eternity. And thats not saying a lot.",PWD_Doc9_Martian-Review,Parker Davis ,Science Fiction ,Negative,The Martian

    Sentiment: positive

With ""Superbad,"" producer Judd Apatow (""Knocked Up,"" ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"") has created another cockeyed hit.

In ""Superbad,"" Michael Cera (left) and Jonah Hill (right) go in search of a teen's holy grail: booze and sex.

The hilarious film offers a younger skew on what must be labeled the Apatow house brand of touchy-feely sex comedy -- in other words, more extreme profanity and juvenile gross-out gags. But all that doesn't make ""Superbad"" bad. Far from it -- this is the funniest picture since ""Borat,"" and more emotionally nuanced than you would expect.

Not that you would expect much in that line, I imagine. Penned by ""Knocked Up"" star Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg when they were still in high school, ""Superbad"" has what screenwriting gurus call a ""quest"" narrative: through a combination of chance and opportunism, Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera, from ""Arrested Development"") are entrusted with securing the alcohol for an end-of-term party.

""You know how when girls sleep with guys, they always say it was an accident?"" reasons Seth, optimistically. ""We could be that accident!"" Video Watch Cera and Hill offer tales from the film 

His plan hinges on their even nerdier pal Fogell (unheralded comedy superhero Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Fogell has a fake ID lined up. Trouble is, when this document materializes, it carries only the single name ""McLovin,"" officially a 25-year-old organ donor from the Aloha State.

Undeterred, brave ""McLovin"" ventures into a liquor store, only to get caught up in an attempted robbery. In the movie's quirkiest detour he spends most of the evening cruising in a patrol car with two unexpectedly paternal, party-hearty cops (Rogen and Bill Hader). Meanwhile, Seth and Evan gamely try to parlay a traffic accident into hard booze.

Anyone even remotely schooled in teen comedy will recognize that ""Superbad"" is an old, old story, albeit one that seems unreasonably determined to lower the taste bar. Each generation throws up a coming-of-age comedy to call its own, whether it's ""American Graffiti"" or ""American Pie,"" and there are equal parts of both here. Fogell could be the son (or the grandson) of Charles Martin Smith's Terry the Toad from the Lucas film. (There's also a blast of the Bar-Kays' ""Soul Finger"" on the predominantly funk soundtrack.)

Mostly, though, we're reminded that Seth Rogen's association with Judd Apatow goes all the way back to the cult NBC series ""Freaks and Geeks"" when he was 16. ""Superbad"" could be an R-rated episode from that show.

Although it takes place over 24 hours or so, the film's period is a bit hazy. These geeks don't talk about sports. They don't talk about music or movies (hardly) ... or politics (as if!). They certainly don't talk about whatever it is they're learning in high school (in Seth's case, apparently, not much). Sometimes they talk about girls. But that's just an important but not vital adjunct to the real Topic A: the penis.

The male sex organ and its potential applications are contemplated endlessly, inside and out, with Seth and Evan turning ideas over in their minds with the same mixture of curiosity, creativity and awe scientists dedicate to quantum physics and basketball fans reserve for the career of Steve Nash.

Of course such overheated bravado is utterly transparent. Seventeen-year-old virgins, they are distressingly ignorant when it comes to the opposite sex and terrified of the mystery that lurks there.

Directing his first feature since the indie gem ""The Daytrippers,"" Greg Mottola takes care to ground the improbable plot in a realistic, low-rent neighborhood and authentic characterizations. If the guileless Mintz-Plasse steals the show, Cera and Hill play off each other beautifully. The intentionally and hilariously anti-climactic ending crystallizes the movie's fairly subtle emotional subtext. Soon it will be time to put aside childish things, and for Seth and Evan, this includes each other.

""Superbad"" is a four-letter raunch-a-rama with a heart, and an inordinate interest in other key organs. It is autobiographical, I suspect, inspired not just by the lives of co-writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who named the two leads after themselves, but possibly by millions of other teenagers. The movie is astonishingly foul-mouthed, but in a fluent, confident way where the point isn't the dirty words, but the flow and rhythm, and the deep, sad yearning they represent.
The movie involves best friends Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera), who have been inseparable, mainly because they were equally unpopular, and now face the ordeal of attending different colleges. It is three weeks until the end of the high school year, bringing to mind the ancient truism that if you haven't had sex yet and you don't have it soon, you will never have had sex in high school. Such deprivation used to be commonplace; I am of the opinion that only about two members of the Urbana High School graduating class of 1960 had experienced sex, but I'll double-check at our next reunion. I will say, though, that at the end of senior year, third base was seeing a lot of traffic.
Seth is the pudgy, curly-haired one, and Evan is thin and has worried eyes. They have a sidekick named Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who is so unpopular, he is unpopular even with them. They all feel lust for every girl in the school, but are so stuck for conversation that sometimes they simply say what time it is, as if they've been asked.
To their wonderment, Seth, Evan and even Fogell are invited to a party on the last night by the uber-popular Jules (Emma Stone), who belatedly explains that it's not a BYO party, but a BYOAEE party (bring your own and everybody else's).
Their attempts to buy booze while underage are more bizarre than some I have witnessed, involving Fogell's production of an ID card claiming he is ""McLovin,"" and they discover that being the guys who bring the booze is a powerful deterrent to unpopularity. (Note: Underage drinking is WRONG.) Jules is very happy to see the three friends and their brown paper bags, and Evan is amazed that even the fragrant Becca (Martha MacIsaac) has a smile for him, and lots else.
To be sure, the lads are not seeking perfect love. They have heard about girls who get drunk and sleep with the wrong guy, and their modest ambition is simply to be the wrong guy. (Note: There is a thin line between being the wrong guy and being a criminal.) Fogell, for that matter, would be happy to even be the wrong wrong guy. (Note: Let's stop these notes and make a blanket announcement: This movie was made by professionals. Do not attempt any of this behavior yourself.)
But back to Fogell. What strange ability do teenagers have, to always choose the school's future millionaire brainiacs and call them by their last names? For Fogell, poor wretch, there is nothing left in life but to found Microsoft. The actor in the role, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, is an actual high-schooler who got the job at a casting call, and it may be a starmaker. I am informed by the ""Superbad"" expert David Plummer: ""There are already T-shirts being sold with 'I Am McLovin' printed on them.""
Anyway, two cops (Bill Hader and co-author Seth Rogen, in what I assume is a non-autobiographical role) bust the party, and so original is this film that they are not the usual bullies, but young enough that when a door opens upon the likes of Jules and Becca and the brown paper bags, they begin to lean eagerly over the doorsill.
The movie reminded me a little of ""National Lampoon's Animal House,"" except that it's more mature, as all movies are. It has that unchained air of getting away with something. In its very raunchiness, it finds truth, because if you know nothing about sex, how can you be tasteful and sophisticated on the subject?
In its treatment of adolescent sexual yearning, ""Superbad"" remembers not only the agony but the complete absence of the ecstasy. I remember in eighth grade some kid asked how long you could entertain an impure thought before it got upgraded from a venial to a mortal sin. ""There aren't rules for things like that,"" the sister explained, ""but I'd say that after five seconds, you're asking for it."" The kid and his buddy went down to his basement to study his dad's collection of Playboys, and he got a stopwatch and had his buddy punch him in the arm every four seconds.

""I'm sorry,"" the boy tells the girl whose posterior he's just whipped with some surgical tubing. ""Your butt was calling to me."" This assertion of anatomical enthusiasm was the second line voiced by Seth Rogen's character on ""Freaks and Geeks,"" the critically acclaimed but short-lived NBC dramedy produced by Judd Apatow in 1999-2000. Over the subsequent eight years, Rogen and Apatow have collaborated frequently, first on television--following ""Freaks and Geeks,"" there was the also acclaimed, also cancelled Fox show ""Undeclared""--and subsequently on the big screen, where their interest in intimate body parts and what can be done with them has only grown more pronounced. In a supporting role in Apatow's 2005 The 40 Year Old Virgin, and again this year as his lead in Knocked Up, Rogen has, in Apatow's words, always pushed him to be more ""outrageously dirty.""
This will come as no surprise to anyone braving the Apatow-produced, Rogen-penned teen sex comedy Superbad, one of the most remarkably--and, at its best, hilariously--filthy examples of the genre ever produced. The story is so simple it's almost primal: Two clumsy high-school seniors, Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) want to get laid. To accomplish this goal, they seek to acquire alcohol for a party being thrown by girls they like. The purpose is twofold: By bringing booze to the party, they will establish themselves as sexually worthy; by getting the girls copiously drunk, they will render themselves sexually irresistible.
The weak link in this otherwise flawless chain of logic comes in the form of their geeky friend--that is to say, more geeky than they are, which is saying a lot--Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who has recently acquired a fake ID and is therefore crucial to their plans. The fact that Fogell chose to describe himself on his new ID as a 25-year-old Hawaiian organ-donor named ""McLovin"" is only the first hint of the difficulties that will lie ahead. Fogell is caught in the midst of a liquor-store robbery and subsequently befriended by the police officers at the scene, who teach him the finer points of alcohol consumption, picking up chicks, and gunplay. Meanwhile, Seth and Evan (so named after Rogen and his co-writer, Evan Goldberg) make an unscheduled detour to a shindig hosted by a seedy thug and his ostentatiously menstruating girlfriend, at which Evan is forced to perform the Guess Who's ""These Eyes"" before a group of hostile cokeheads. All three boys, of course, ultimately make it to the party for their intended, though ultimately fraught, sexual assignations.
If this plot sounds a tad halfhearted, that's because it is. During the central part of the film, the quest for booze, there are some good gags--notably, a disastrous cell-phone call between Evan and his would-be girlfriend--but plenty that land flat as well. This middle portion isn't bad, but it's not particularly memorable either: We've seen comparable bits in the American Pie movies, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, Road Trip, and any number of other cheerfully adolescent diversions.
Where Superbad really sings--again, in the filthiest key imaginable--is in the moments when nothing much is happening at all. The first 20 minutes or so of the movie consist almost exclusively of raunchy repartee between Seth and Evan--in the car, on the football field, during Home Ec class. Discussing what porn site Seth should subscribe to, they weigh competing values: quantity, variety, degree of explicitness, how obvious the charge will be when it shows up on a credit card bill. (""What about 'Perfect 10'?"" suggests Evan. ""That could be anything. That could be a bowling site."") Later, Seth's confession of his childhood passion for drawing penises is among the lewdest set pieces ever committed to celluloid, a dirty joke that continues to build on itself long after achieving comedic critical mass.
There's an obscene genius to these scenes, but also an almost infantile innocence. When Seth and Evan are perusing a skin mag at a local convenience store, one of them even remarks approvingly that a model's nipples look like ""little baby toes."" These are boys who know nothing about girls and not much more about themselves, whose overdeveloped awareness of sex is a thin mask over their terror of it. In typical Apatow fashion, they are male life partners grappling with the imminent separation that adult heterosexuality will entail (though for a change doing it during actual, not extended, adolescence). Toward the end of the movie, the two boys, snugly and drunkenly ensconced in adjacent sleeping bags, repeatedly declare to one another, ""I love you, man."" (""I want to shout it from the rooftops!"" adds Evan.) The scene is funny for all the usual reasons, but still more so because their boozy proclamations are so self-evidently true. The next morning finds them once again in lewd banter mode, as Seth tries on too-tight pants at the mall with Evan. The resulting discussion of male genital topography (""It looks like a division sign,"" offers Evan) is surely the most humorous since Ben Stiller zipped up prematurely in There's Something About Mary. But then, as the credits prepare to roll, the girls arrive and the boys split off with them, sinister adulthood again encroaching.
The movie is ably directed by Greg Mottola (The Daytrippers) and features likable supporting performances by Rogen and Bill Hader as the oversolicitous cops, and Emma Stone and Martha MacIsaac as the pretty-but-approachable love interests. Jonah Hill, who played one of Rogen's stoner buddies in Knocked Up, is good as Seth, the loud-mouthed fat-guy character who will be familiar to anyone who's seen an American comedy in the last 30 years. And Christopher Mintz-Plasse is equally humorous (though almost certain to be overrated) as the twiggy spaz Fogell/McLovin, a slightly less prehensile variation on your typical D.J. Qualls role.
But the film really belongs to Michael Cera, who as Evan captures teenage sexual abashment as indelibly as he did in the role of George Michael on the late, never sufficiently lamented ""Arrested Development."" Cera, whose smooth, slightly rounded face brings to mind an early Jim Henson creation, is so adept at conveying the innocent desperation of male adolescence, so low-key and genuine (especially compared to Jason Biggs and other hammy purveyors of the nice-guy-who-still-wants-to-get-laid shtick) that he can at times be almost painful to watch. He also, at 19, has some of the best comic timing of anyone working in film today, a precocious sense of the awkward pauses and misread cues in which social panic resides. One might have to go all the way back to Bob Newhart to find a comedian so keenly attuned to the humor that lurks in the spaces between the jokes.
Little wonder then, that so many of Superbad's best moments are relatively quiet ones. Like funny people in general--and, one assumes, Rogen, Goldberg, Apatow et al. in particular--Seth and Evan are at their best when just shooting the shit, when their comic imaginations are not limited by the demands of physical possibility, however distended. There was a similar formula to The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, in which many of the most hysterical scenes took place outside the central narrative and consisted merely of grown men sitting around acting like idiots. Likewise, in Superbad, the boys ultimately learn something about sex, and friendship, and respecting women. But the movie's real lesson is this: There is nothing as dirty--and, in the right circumstances, as hilarious--as the mind of a 17-year-old boy.

The latest comic meteorite to hurtle forth from the galaxy of producer Judd Apatow, Superbad is about a couple of chronically unpopular best friends who, after four years stuck on the lowest rung of the high-school social ladder, find themselves invited to a legitimately cool party. Goodbye, Friday nights chugging Old Milwaukees in their parents furnished basements; hello, getting shitfaced in the company of a few dozen of their not particularly close friends. More importantly, having completed their independent study in Internet porn, our heroes finally get the chance to put their virtual carnal knowledge to practical use. Provided, that is, they can actually get to the party.

Yes, Superbad is about one of those nightswhen you finally have the chance to prove that youre not as big of a dork as everyone thinks, only to be chased by the cops, hit by a car (twice), and nearly pulverized by the dude whose girlfriends menstrual blood somehow ends up on your pant leg, as well as to drunkenly embarrass yourself in front of the one girl you have real feelings for. You know, one of those nights. But Im getting a little ahead of myself.

For starters: Superbad was written by Knocked Up star Seth Rogen and co-writer Evan Goldberg, who cooked up the first draft of the script when they were in high schoolwhich helps to explain why the movie feels so knowing in every one of its clumsily averted glances and frank discussions of things like the best way to camouflage an erection. Rogen and Goldberg even named the lead characters after themselves, though a few drafts later they are equally recognizable as specimens bred in the Apatow gene poolthe sort of kids you knew in high school, or maybe were yourself, who seem a touch young for their age, who are more book smart than street smart, and who live in abject terror at the thought of going off to college with their virginity intact.

More geek than freak, chubby, motor-mouthed Seth (Jonah Hill) perpetually brings up the rear in gym class and gets spat on by the resident senior-class bully, while gangly, soft-spoken Evan (Michael Cera)who can run like the wind but doesnt really get the point of things like sportsstands dutifully at his side, an introspective Sancho to his brash Quixote. True to form, they pine for girls who seem out of their respective leagues: Evan for nice-girl Becca (Martha MacIsaac), whose obvious flirtations he cluelessly rebuffs; Seth for the comely Jules (Emma Stone). Then the act of divine intervention pairs Seth and Jules in a home-economics project and results in the popular girl inviting
the dork (and his dork friend) to her graduation party. But, as mentioned, getting to that hallowed place proves easier said than done. In fact, it turns into something like the
Lord of the Rings of adolescent nookie moviesa calamitous, hazard-filled journey toward the fiery gates of Mount Poon.

At 19 and 23 respectively, Cera and Hill have the fully developed comic timing of seasoned prosBob Hope and Bing Crosby in sneakers and cargo shorts. Yet, Superbad is routinely stolen right out from under them by an 18-year-old newcomer, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who was plucked from MySpace obscurity to play the unapologetically dweeby third wheel, Fogell, and who embraces the part with such unbridled comic brio that the characterand his fake-ID alias, McLovinis bound for movie-comedy immortality. Following a hilariously botched attempt by our intrepid trio to buy booze using said ID, Superbad effectively splits along two parallel tracks, as Seth and Evan navigate their own circuitous route to Juless house, while Fogell/McLovin winds up getting an unexpected lift from two police officers (played by Rogen and Saturday Night Lives Bill Hader) who make the Keystone Kops look like paragons of law and order.

Directed by Greg Mottola (an alumnus, like Hill, of Apatows short-lived TV series Undeclared), Superbad is duly ribald and often achingly funny, brewed from the now-familiar Apatow house blend of go-for-broke slapstick and instantly quotable, potty-mouthed dialogue. (Im so jealous you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby, a wistful Seth tells Evan after an encounter with his friends amply bosomed mother.) But what sets Superbad far apart from the American Pie seriesindeed, what earns it a place alongside American Graffiti, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and Dazed and Confused in that elite strata of high-school comedies destined to stand the test of timeis its sweet, soulful vulnerability, particularly as it becomes clear that the only thing Seth and Evan feel more anxious about than losing their virginity is the thought of losing each other, in the fall, when they head off to separate colleges. That naughty-but-nice approach might seem something of an Apatow clich by now if the characters themselves didnt ring so true. Make no mistake: Superbad is a movie about getting wasted and getting laid, but it is above all an ode to the end of teenage innocence in all its wonderful, horrible splendor.

	Once a super-genre, always a super-genre. Hollywood will never scatter the westerns ashes with finality, even if it wants to. In the bold and contrary winds of Americas outdoors, they will always blow back in its face. So the oater makes another comeback this week with 3.10 to Yuma, reprising a 1958 movie based on a story whose very authorship  by an early-career Elmore Leonard  proves that modern crime and action thrillers are just evolutions of the western. Frontier folklore shaped the derring-do of later America, from the fascination with rebel law-enforcers (Clint Eastwood school of policing) to the tricksy charisma of baddies, who in the old days learned to use the charm of the adventurer-acquisitor, not just the heavy hitting of the crime boss.

Today the western is becoming placeless as well as timeless. These movies are no longer restricted to performers born in the land of sagebrush. After Irelands Liam Neeson and Pierce Brosnan in Seraphim Falls, here are New Zealands Russell Crowe and Britains Christian Bale, donning the hats and accents to play outlaw and escort. They do it with grizzled assurance, as Crowes bandit killer is transported to a jail-bound train, through hazards and ambushes, by Bales small-time farmer and family man, who wants the bounty and the vindicating badge of courage.

Bale combines outward nerve with tics of inner nervousness. Crowe, marvellous, is a teasing bully boy who spins little grins and affabilities from his eyes, counterfeit coins of humanity to fool those eager to keep their trust in human nature. (Youre not all bad, says Bales son. Yes, I am, replies Crowe in a moment of candour.) Director James Mangold overdoes the sepia visual tones. Can we not just once have a new-age western in throbbing, unrestrained colours? But he does justice to the storys grace under pressure and pace under Aristotelian imperative. In the final scenes of train-waiting, narrated in virtual real time, the ticking clock becomes, rightly and resonantly, the main character.

Horror can lurk in the ordinary, even the banal. That is one of the truths of cinema, in a history that has given us Hitchcock, Lewton and Clouzot. In Gla and Tmur Babluanis Legacy, from Georgia, the horror first reveals itself on a humdrum bus journey. Three French tourists, curious about a young man and his granddad travelling with an empty coffin, are told that the coffin is for the older man who will be killed tomorrow. This little shocker puts us straight inside the hearts and heads of the tourists, with whose apparent consternation we identify. But then another shocker distances us from them too. One tourist, travelling with a Camcorder, asks, supported by another, Will we be able to film it?

The scene is a wicked roundelay of cynicisms. The old Georgian is about to be sacrificed to a feudal village dispute. The young French folk put aside dismay to pick up the tools of prurience. But the film itself reaches the summit of its skills here and has nowhere to go but downhill. Gla Babluani, co-directing and co-scripting with his filmmaker father, made the brilliant Thirteen, a Russian roulette drama that left our palms sweating and our heads swimming. But neither of these Babluanis, nor a third, Georges, who plays the grandson with doe-eyed inexpressiveness, can find a strong direction for the last act, which freewheels towards denouement like a driverless bus.

Superbad is a comedy of bad manners co-written by and co-starring Hollywoods new superman of mirth, Seth Rogen. His last film, Knocked Up, was a darling of press and public. His new film was the same in America but hit British critics, to judge by the press show, like a stale, over-large custard pie. Some of us even thought we heard a ghostly voice say, Heres one I made earlier. For this hectic, hormonal jokefeast  about three high-school boys looking for sex, drugs and anything that will take their minds off homework  was Rogens first ever script. He took it out of a drawer, showed it to director Greg Mottola (formerly of The Daytrippers) and everyone said, Eureka! Or perhaps it was Were looking for something long, frantic, fatuous and knockabout and the sentence was misheard.

There is one good performance: Christopher Mintz-Plasse as the nerdy third hero, a lisping, bespectacled cross between Jerry Lewis and a younger Woody Allen. And there is one funny line, by an older character, that could have come from a younger Allen, that forlorn humorist of sexual dynamics. On our wedding night we had group sex. I wasnt actually involved  Elsewhere, the film proves only that a Hollywood fixated on the slapstick potential of teenage growing pains is finding it harder than ever to say, Bye, bye, American Pie.

Im a British nanny and Im dangerous, says Clive Owen in Shoot Em Up. He certainly is not Mary Poppins. This first feature by ex-storyboard artist Michael Davis, whose sales pitch to studios took the form of 17,000 action drawings sequenced into an animation, is like Tom and Jerry on amphetamines.

Questions starting with the words why or how should be left at the door. But as a critic Ill ask them anyway. Why does Owen, a blue-collar, blue-stubbled action thug, rescue a baby from a mum murdered on the streets? Why is Paul Giamatti, identifiable as evil from his dilated eyes, commanding sneer and retinue of goons, seeking this tot? Why is Monica Bellucci, surplus-to-story and ladling a barely comprehensible Italian accent, here at all? And how, since Owens hero eats raw carrots, stabs his enemies with them and then makes Bond-like quips, did we get away without a joke about carroted arteries?

Never mind. The film is so fast it is over almost before it begins and so empty-headed it demands little but your inertia. On the way there are moments of weird charm, conjured by the movies velocity. Best of these is a lovemaking scene between Owen and Bellucci that carries on even while Owen fights off encroaching baddies with gunfire salvoes.

Of two mystery thrillers French and American, choose The Serpent from the EU over Disturbia from the US. Eric Barbiers twisty murder drama is less a whodunit, more a whys-he-doing-it, but like the metric system and the French rail network it makes sense. Yvan Attals photographer falls into a blackmailers hands, a pawn of sexy photos that must be kept from his wife. But why are so many contingent murders occurring, with Attal himself soon weltering in blood? The story came from Get Carters source author, English crime writer Ted Lewis, but the venomous sophistication and serpentine inner logic are French.

Disturbia is a kiddywink Rear Window. Grounded teenager Shia LaBeouf is home but not alone, with a friend and girlfriend sharing his fascination with the sinister activities of new nextdoor neighbour David Morse.

In Hollywood films curtains are always left open, by the good and bad alike. So with almost farcical self-exposure, the suspect man semaphores his fishy behaviour. Take along a good book  possibly Ted Lewiss The Serpent  and read it by the light of the effulgent clichs.

The summer comedy season opened with Judd Apatow's Knocked Up, starring Seth Rogen as a pudgy, mouthy slob who carelessly impregnates pretty Katherine Heigl. The movie is supposed to be the story of how they fall in love, and into shared responsibility. But the scene with the deepest communion of personalities is when the Rogen character gets high in a Vegas motel room with ... Heigl's brother-in-law.

Today we have the summer's last major comedy: Superbad, produced by Apatow and co-written by Rogen. It's about a pudgy, mouthy slob named Seth (Jonah Hill) and his quieter, slightly more kempt buddy Evan (Michael Cera) who want, with variously intense degrees of desperation, to get laid before they graduate from high school. At the end of a night of wacky hijinks, the lads do wind up in a sleeping bag, exchanging intimacies with...each other.

Why don't Apatow and Rogen just do the honorable thing and tell the world they're gay? It would save them a lot of time wasted pretending their movies are about young men growing up and finding the right young woman. It would also save movie critics from having to find new ways of saying, about their maxi-raunch comedies, ""Oh, but at heart they're really sweet.""

And while Hollywood is being honest about the new strain of guy-meets-guy comedy  bromance, the word writer Dave Carnie coined to describe the strong emotional attachment of one man for another  maybe Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler should come out of the closet too. In Ferrell's movies, male merging beats female interest to a pulp, and his latest, Blades of Glory, allows him several opportunities to stick his face in Jon Heder's crotch. Sandler's summer hit, I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, took guy-guy friendship to its logical conclusion: two firefighters get married. At least that seemed as far as boy-meets-boy comedies could go, until Superbad's cuddle-up scene.

And yet there may be one more border to cross. When Apatow appeared last week on The Colbert Report, and was asked what was possibly left to show in male comedies, he instantly answered, ""A penis."" I don't doubt that Apatow was speaking ironically, yet there was self-revelation there to, since that's exactly the sexual organ that the fellows in Knocked Up and Superbad (and his earlier The 40-Year-Old Virgin) are most obsessed by.

I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU JUDD AND SETH

I'm in a pretty small minority of critics who aren't enchanted by the Apatow movies. The first four reviews I read online this morning of Superbad, all by women, in the New York and L.A. Timeses and the Washington and New York Posts, ranged from favorable to ecstatic. Manohla Dargis' notice in the New York Times described the film's phallo-neurosis with a gusto that soared into poetry: ""If the penis is puzzled in Portnoy's Complaint, as Alexander Portnoy's shrink believes, in Superbad it is thoroughly, stunningly clueless and as violently tremulous as a divining rod at Hoover Dam."" (Congrats to Manohla, by the way, for getting shrink and penis into the same sentence.) The token male critic I consulted, Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal, was just as enthusiastic: this ""bawdy, big-hearted"" comedy is a ""canny evocation of male friendship in all its richness and complexity."" It's as if all these worthy scribes have the rapture, and I'm left behind. 

A few caveats, then, before I go ranting on like the crank at the christening. I'm not a prude. I enjoy a good dirty joke, including more than a few in Knocked Up and Superbad. In my time I've praised ribald comedies (Clerks comes immediately to mind) and male-bonding frolics (Sideways). I don't mind the Apatow movies; I'm not trying to make anyone feel guilty for liking them more than I do. I just wonder why they've become the template for popular and critically acclaimed comedy, and why guy-guy is just about the only kind around.

I guess I have to say that, like most other liberal New York heterosexuals I'm a card-carrying homophiliac; so in calling the films closet-gay, I'm not saying that's a bad thing. It just strikes me as a dominant trend in the year's comedies (and action films, like 300 and Spider-Man 3).

Chuck & Larry, which opened four weeks ago, has already earned more than $100 million at the domestic box office; this is Sandler's sixth consecutive year with a comedy that reached that healthy number. The movie is about two hetero firefighters  Sandler as Chuck and Kevin James as Larry  who pretend to be homosexual because, the script says, Larry can then get a better insurance policy for his kids. But it's really because the film wants to indulge in both gay propaganda and gay bashing. Larry, still grieving over a wife three years dead, is the more evolved of the two; he feels no threat from the queer agenda, nor much interest in it. It's Chuck who has problems even being considered gay. At their wedding, Larry is willing to exchange a perfunctory kiss; Chuck socks him. I now pronounce you Homo and Phobia.

The film then spends most of its time trying to cure Chuck of his animosity toward gays. He attends a gay ball dressed as Count Dracula and befriends a tough cop who's secretly gay. Finally he convinces his macho pals in the firehouse, who had turned on him and Larry, that gay ain't so bad. The ""gay"" firemen's presumed crimes against nature matter less than their membership in the anti-arson brotherhood; camaraderie is the straight version of gay pride.

GAY-NECOLOGY

In Superbad, inattentively directed by Greg Mottola, the quasi-gay subtext is so obvious, it's the love that dares to shriek its name. What I identified as guy-necology in my review of Knocked Up blossoms into gay-necology here.

Superbad was written by Rogen and Evan Goldberg, his boyhood pal from Vancouver; he says they started the script when they were 13. The film has obvious autobiographical elements, beyond the writers' naming the main characters after themselves and setting it in their senior year in high school, when Goldberg got into Dartmouth and Rogen didn't. That's what happens to Evan and Seth in the movie.

Nothing Krafft-Ebing about separation anxiety, or, in Seth's case, Ivy envy. It's refreshing for a high school movie to acknowledge that kids can agonize as much about grades and college as they do about sex. But Seth is also jealous that Evan might be sleeping with  all right, sharing a dorm room with  their nerdiest classmate, Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who also was accepted at Dartmouth. And Seth needs to have sex with a cool girl named Jules (note: guy's name) that night, that very night, not to commune with her, or even to get orgasmic pleasure for the first time from another person, but so he can practice sexual techniques with someone he knows and be a stud at the state college he's destined for. But what the 18-year-old virgin really needs, and ends up getting, is bedtime with Evan.

One more and. Seth confesses that when he was eight he obsessively created drawings of penises. The movie ends with dozens of ornate examples of his draftsmanship. 

Somewhere buried in Superbad is the poignant coming-of-age fable  the glimmer of a suggestion that Seth's dependence on Evan is adolescent, even infantile, and that at some point he has to grow up and accept that friends can be a continent apart and still be close. Or not close: friendships, like erections, can subside. But to find that valuable truth, you have to dig through an avalanche of d--- jokes and strenuous slapstick.

Anyway, I'm glad the movie exists, because it has a fabulous performance by Mintz-Plasse, a first-time movie actor with a beguiling, almost cunning dorkishness. The comedy comes from Fogell's belief that he is somehow cool, though he must have been told the opposite three times a day since he was in pre-school. Apatow has a habit of promoting his featured losers to starring roles. Rogen was one of Steve Carell's friend-torturers in The 40-Year-Old Virgin before getting Knocked Up, and Hill was a Rogen buddy in that film before Superbad. From this natural selection of the lamest, Mintz-Plasse has proved he merits a full-length Fogell feature.

MEN WITHOUT WOMEN

School comedies from as far back as Harold Lloyd's The Freshman in 1925 set up the basic conflict of nerd vs. jock. The athlete was seen as stuck-up, taking adulation as his due, knowing ""you gotta be a football hero to win the love of a beautiful girl."" So virtually every high school or college comedy dramatized the triumph of the outsider against the sportsman establishment. In 1989, Heathers lifted that vengefulness to a tragicomic delirium.

In Superbad and other contemporary school movies, the misfit heroes are usually mocked or brutalized by the athletes. Well, it's true that the nerds' main form of exercise is masturbation, but they are every bit as competitive as the towel-snapping guys on the football team. The difference is that their aggression is verbal, not physical. Instead of wanting to score the winning touchdown, they want to top their friends in the display of ribald wit. They're joke jocks. And since they don't think girls are funny (their touchstone movie ""classics"" are Caddyshack and Porky's, not Earth Girls Are Easy and Clueless), and since the jokes they make often have a pretty deep misogynist streak, they play to the one audience they think will appreciate them: their male friends, which is to say, themselves. To each his Onan.

In this all-guy world, girls are the mysterious Other  which, from my teen recollections, sounds about right. But they are only the goal: get the girl because of the challenge. They are not only unknowable, they're hardly worth knowing. They're a treat to see swinging their hips as they pass the misfits; but they don't understand the guy game, which is to assert domination by being rudely clever. They can walk the walk but they can't talk the talk.

Being long past my youth, I can't say if this is sociologically accurate. But males and females not charming and testing one another by talking  that's a big change from the best old movies.

It was clear as long ago as the late 80s, and When Harry Met Sally (not Larry) that talk was the new sex. But in that film Meg Ryan got laughs by faking an orgasm. If you go back to some of the great romantic comedies of the 30s and 40s  Bombshell, The Awful Truth, The Women, Midnight, Ball of Fire, The Lady Eve, Adam's Rib  you'll see that women got to be at least as witty as the men, and that was very witty indeed. And it wasn't only male writers inventing funny things for actresses to say; some of these films were written by women (as was When Harry Met Sally).

Hollywood thinks girls aren't funny any more. Today, smart or sassy talk is something only the guys get to do. In The 40-Year-Old Virgin the main attraction of the female romantic interest played by Catherine Keener is that she laughs at Carell's jokes. The Apatow dictum (ha-ha, I said dictum) is that women can't aspire to equality in cracking jokes, but guys will indulge them and let them be the receptive audience.

Which is about all that's left for female moviegoers to do. Except for the months from December to February, when the tonier Oscar hopefuls allow some good roles for actresses, women have practically disappeared from movies. A decade ago, when the teen audience had established itself as the dominant box office demographic, producers scrambled to ""young down"" their projects, casting actors in their 20s for roles written for characters in their 30s and 40s. Now, I wonder, are producers ""guying up"" their movies? Are they having romantic comedy and drama scripts rewritten from guy-girl to guy-guy?

I mean  subtextually, of course  gay-gay.

American movies generally want us to do more than like a character. They want us to root for him.

This necessitates charm, wit, humility, talent, a handsome face, something. A few movies take a character's likability for granted, as though his very circumstances are enough to make us root for him, as though the act of cheering on a character will make us love him. It should really be the other way around: Affection should inspire support.

""Superbad"" is one of those movies that has this backward. It assumes that the desperate adolescent boy's quest for sex is so universal that we'd root for anybody to score, regardless of whether we love the kids in pursuit. The movie wants us to cheer on husky Seth (Jonah Hill) and noodly Evan (Michael Cera) in a quest to buy alcohol for a big party, where, God willing, two girls will take their virginity.

The ecstatically amused audience I saw it with didn't have any problem loving the movie or anticipating these two losing it. But I was never sufficiently seduced. I didn't like Seth and couldn't rouse myself to root for him. Needless to say, it was a lonely two hours.

Set in a virtually unparented American everyburb, ""Superbad"" has a degree more sophistication than ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and ""American Pie,"" and less than the underrated ""House Party."" It's just as ribald as all of them. The movie spends a couple of days and one long night with Seth and Evan in the months before they leave for college. Their plan never to be apart has been upended since only Evan got into Dartmouth, and the movie's emotional subtext very much involves Seth's heartbreak over the possible loss of his best friend.

""Superbad"" emerges from the increasingly successful happy comedy family whose central figure is Judd Apatow. He wrote and directed ""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" and produced this movie. The writers are Evan Goldberg and ""Knocked Up"" star Seth Rogen, childhood friends who've named the characters after themselves. Director Greg Mottola has overseen some excellent canceled TV series, including ""Arrested Development"" and Apatow's own ""Undeclared.""

""Superbad"" has some of that Apatow feeling. The few smart observations could have come from an episode of one of his TV shows. But the movie is missing the gentle moral authority and most of the human warmth. (There is one affectionate moment between Seth and Evan in a sleeping bag that suggests a suburban ""Y Tu Mama Tambien,"" and one disagreement between them evokes the wounded spats in Barry Levinson's ""Diner."") ""Superbad"" also lacks a funny woman or at least some female perspective -- it would have been nice to hear what the girls see in these boys.

The filmmakers are much more interested in Seth's combustibility. He is explosively vulgar. The camera gets in close on his face as he screams frustrated obscenities at whomever. Humiliation (once, he's bled on; twice, he's hit by a car) only seems to make him worse. His unpopular status in school seems warranted: He's toxic and selfish.

""Superbad"" belongs to that family of horny-misfit movies -- outcast boys want to hook up with cool girls but they've been too preoccupied with their obsessions to have learned how. But sex has been Seth's nerdy obsession, and he is pathological about every aspect of it. In explaining his contempt for the girl Evan likes, Seth tells a story, which the movie dramatizes, about how, years ago, she glimpsed one of his copious penis drawings. His phallophilia appears to have inspired his misogyny. That the movie knows the character is a lech doesn't make him any more fun.

Hill, who looks older than a high school senior, has had small parts of a similar vein in ""Knocked Up"" and ""Evan Almighty."" He was like a condiment in those movies. A little went a long, enjoyable way. As the star of his own film, he's a bowl of mustard. He has Albert Brooks's defensive sense of superiority (and a version of his wild curly hair), but he rarely gets to express that superiority as wit. It comes out in the form of breathless exclamatory expletives.

When I laughed at Hill it was when he was given something remotely printable to say. (He has a very funny line about manual sex, camouflage, and Vietnam.) But it's hard to build an entire movie around his kind of negativity. And as sweetly funny as Cera is in letting some of his lines just trail off unfinished (he was underrated as Jason Bateman's son on ""Arrested Development""), he's not substantial enough a presence to wrest the movie away from Hill.

The filmmakers take breaks from these two to give us time with Seth and Evan's extremely geeky buddy Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who, after a mishap purchasing liquor with a fake ID, spends the movie riding along with a pair of reckless nincompoop cops, played by Rogen and Bill Hader. These scenes are tiresome and unpleasant (they look like they've been shot through beer goggles), but Mintz-Plasse has great comic style. He whines and wheezes his lines with a kind of broken musicality, and his face is often caught making an expression somewhere between shock and a sneeze.

As films about the young and the horny go, I preferred the smarter approach director Jeffrey Blitz takes in ""Rocket Science,"" a comedy that also opens here today. ""Superbad"" feels confused by comparison. It's an R-rated film with the simple sensibility of a show that might play on the teen cable channel The N. But it's also thoroughly entrenched in a retrograde adolescence that keeps slipping outside teen comedy into the territory of the horror film. ""American Pie,"" whose makers tried to give their inexperienced lads some carnal knowledge, did the same thing: It turned sex into something you'd expect to see in ""The Exorcist.""

""Superbad"" comes up with mysterious menstrual blood, pre-coital puking, violently possessive 30-something cokeheads, and terrified reaction shots to it all. I wanted to find this as funny as audiences did. But it mostly made me understand the case for staying a virgin until you're 40.

Every generation deserves its own phrase-generating teen comedy.

From ""Where were you in '62?"" (American Graffiti) to ""It's casual"" (The Wild Life), all the way through ""This one time, at band camp . . ."" (American Pie).

Superbad shamelessly steals from them all. A super-derivative, super-raunchy, super-sized sack of laughs, it's the great vulgarian send-off to the summer of Knocked Up, with a lot of the same people involved.

And the catchphrase? I'm betting on ""I am McLovin."" Or ""Samezies"" or ""That was pimp."" Those are the only PG-rated ones.

The story gives us pals Evan and Seth (Michael Cera and Jonah Hill), ready to graduate, anxious to finally make some carnal progress with the opposite sex, wishing they had fake IDs so they could score liquor.

Evan (Cera) is sensitive and a bit of a high-talker. Seth (Hill, looking and acting like an obese, underage Seth Rogen) is a porn-addicted virgin whose crassness Evan thinks is weird.

These last days of school and nights of parties (which they're never asked to) are bittersweet for this odd couple. Seth is going ""to State,"" Evan got into Dartmouth.

A party comes up that they're invited to. The friendly Jules (Emma Stone) calls Seth's big-party-dude bluff and asks him to bring the liquor, the implication being that she may drink enough of it to make Seth irresistible. And the girl Evan is moon-faced over will be there, drunk too, in all likelihood.

Oh, you're thinking. Young love. Graduation party. Alcohol. One last chance to get it right with Ms. Right. Can't Hardly Wait.

And there's your source material, a 1998 teen comedy that was a lot cleaner than this one. Judd Apatow, the Freaks & Geeks alum who has become comedy's ""it"" boy (The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up) produced this, and Knocked Up's Seth Rogen co-wrote it. Greg Mottola (Daytrippers, TV's Undeclared) directed it, and the movie they have delivered is a Freaks & Geeks: Uncensored.

This long day's journey into the liquor store (American Graffiti) is filled with blunders, brawls, uneasy interaction with cops (SNL's Bill Hader and co-writer Rogen) and the worst menstrual joke in the history of the cinema.

Christopher Mintz-Plasse is the geekiest of the geeks, the pal who has overthought his pursuit of a fake ID (It has one name on it, ""McLovin."") He's the one who gets the booze, who falls in with the cops and spends a wild night drinking, running the siren to skip through red lights and generally mixing it up with some less-than-dedicated peace officers.

Evan and Seth feud their way through a liquor-acquiring Plan B.

With the climax, of course, coming at the party, where everybody's path intersects.

The recycled plot isn't a worry here, any more than the sort-of sexism in it. The women, as in the original American Pie, are more complicated than simple sex objects but still are mostly in the background. The comical coarseness from Hill is funny enough to cover it.

But like Knocked Up, this is a comedy they don't know how to end. The energy flags as it overstays its welcome. The Apatow Rule, ""If it gets a laugh, don't cut it,"" doesn't do movies under his banner any favors. Still, there are plenty of those laughs, from the ruder-than-rude opening to the ironic-sentimental ending.

Oh, if only my kids were teenagers so I could forbid them from seeing it.

Horny is as horny does in the sweetly absurd high school comedy Superbad. A tickly, funny tale of three teenage boys revved up by their surging, churning, flooding hormones, the movie joins the tumescent ranks of similarly themed works about male sexual desire  consider Portnoys Complaint, think Porkys  and its somatic epiphanies, treacherous secretions, anguished lessons and apparently limitless storehouse of embarrassments. Behold the man (well, boy): fully sexed and wholly, touchingly virginal.
Written by Seth Rogen, last seen scoring in Knocked Up, and his childhood friend Evan Goldberg, Superbad follows two high school seniors  also named Seth and Evan  who together set off on a long nights journey into the soul. Actually, what they do is try to booze up and party down with some school hotties during a nighttown adventure in missed opportunities and unexpected revelations. Time is short: summer looms, as does the fall, when Evan (Michael Cera, excellent) will depart for Dartmouth alongside his classmate Fogell (the newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse), leaving behind his academically challenged best friend, Seth (Jonah Hill). The future holds promise, even for Seth, yet also threatens the worst, especially if they dont become some girls morning- after headache.
We could be that mistake! insists Seth, his voice shrill with hope and panic.
If the penis is puzzled in Portnoys Complaint, as Alexander Portnoys shrink believes, in Superbad it is thoroughly, stunningly clueless and as violently tremulous as a divining rod at Hoover Dam. Along with Fogell, a walking irritant with mad skills (he procures a fake ID), Seth and Evan prowl their high school in search of  what, precisely? From their bawdy language, filled with vivid anatomical notes and gaudily colorful phrasing, the three would very much like to bed some ladies, as Fogell insists on calling them in a tragicomic bid at Kanye West suavity. The tearful joke being that these yapping pups wouldnt know what to do with any woman, much less the bosomy babes of their whipped-cream and dirty dreams.
The divide between what a man says  and what he thinks he should say, especially to other men  and how he really feels inside largely defines the comedic ethos of Judd Apatow, one of the movies producers and its spiritual laughing light. Much like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up, both of which Mr. Apatow directed and either wrote or helped write, Superbad largely works not because the jokes are funny, which they generally are, even on the spitometer. It works because no matter how unapologetically vulgar their words, no matter how single-mindedly priapic their preoccupations, these men and boys are good and decent and tender and true. They never take cruel or callous advantage. They call. They love. They marry.
Mr. Apatow traffics in such a cute, cuddly vision of modern masculinity that it seems rude to wonder if its honestly felt (which is what I think), self-flattering (ditto) or cunningly opportunistic (nah). Certainly its testosterone-heavy, if not exactly macho. And, indeed, part of whats fascinating about Mr. Apatows ascendancy, and why the comedy moment belongs to him more than it does either to the Farrelly brothers or to Ben Stiller and his mob, is how he has created  and come close to perfecting  a masculine variation on aspirational wish-fulfillment movies like Legally Blonde. Except instead of perky, pretty women reaching up, up, up, Mr. Apatow offers freaks and geeks aching to be worthy of those same women.
And if these guys arent especially worthy, well, such is the way of the wish-fulfillment fantasy. Mr. Apatow shamelessly stacks the deck in favor of his underdogs  the future doctors, lawyers and Hollywood hitmakers of America, no doubt  but his intentions are generally righteous and his humor doesnt depend too heavily on flatulence or sadism. Or filmmaking.
Given Mr. Apatows tendencies, its no surprise that the director of Superbad, Greg Mottola, doesnt leave much of an imprint. Mr. Mottola, whose first and last big-screen effort was the fine 1996 comedy The Daytrippers, has spent much of the last decade working in network television (sometimes with Mr. Apatow) and it shows. In Superbad, his setups and camerawork serve the characters unobtrusively, as do the homey production design and costumes.
Its a nice homeyness, lived-in and honest. Much like Mr. Rogen, who alongside Bill Hader puts in an unfortunately overextended appearance in Superbad as a dangerously juvenile cop, the young male actors in Superbad look as pleasantly, sympathetically real as they behave. Theyre at a total and happy remove from the musclebound cartoons of prime-time and action-flick reveries.
Long and lanky, Mr. Cera moves like one of those teenagers whose body hasnt yet fully caught up to his newly reached height. With his wide-open face and smile, he looks absolutely amazed by what he can see from a higher elevation (the world!). But of course he looks surprised: hes the top half of the exclamation point to the spherical Mr. Hills rolling big dot.

Recent US comedy has been dominated by the 'Frat Pack', presided over by Will Ferrell. His 2004 vehicle Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy in turn spawned a new gang led by actor-writers Steve Carell and Seth Rogen, and writer-director Judd Apatow, all of whom collaborated on The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) and the current Knocked Up. This generation - for whom Vanity Fair will surely find a hip new tag just as soon as it dispatches Annie Leibovitz to photograph them for a fold-out cover - has an air of geeky self-deprecation that makes their films less showbizzy than those of the Frat Pack, and arguably funnier.

Superbad, co-written by Rogen and produced by Apatow, is a raucous party movie best enjoyed with a crowd. Although Rogen appears as a feckless police officer, the picture is dominated by three plucky young actors (Michael Cra, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who play high-school graduates Evan, Seth and Fogell, gearing up for a last party before college. Seth and Evan will no longer see one another when the latter departs for prestigious Dartmouth while the former attends a state college; Seth's resentment simmers away throughout the film, though for now he has his sights set on sex. If he provides the booze for a party being held by Jules, the object of his affection, then he reckons he'll get to sleep with her. This is where the drippy Fogell comes in: having secured a fake ID under the ill-fitting pseudonym McLovin, he is the key to Seth's plan.

The movie treads identical ground to American Graffiti (1973) and Dazed and Confused (1993), but what distinguishes it is a post-Porky's sensibility that simultaneously satirises and celebrates pre-PC smuttiness. Rogen and his co-writer Evan Goldberg wrote for the US series Da Ali G Show, and their semi-autobiographical Superbad script shares a lopsided perspective with Sacha Baron Cohen's work. Just as last year's Borat movie exploited for laughs the kind of xenophobic prejudices that we have largely abandoned or repressed, so Superbad draws its humour from the inexperienced heroes' chauvinistic assessments of sex. Seth tells Evan that women ""pride themselves on their dick-taking abilities"", and likens a woman's nipples to ""babies' toes"". Adults are hardly more sophisticated. Officer Michaels, played by Rogen, admits that police work is nothing like the forensics-heavy procedure CSI had led him to expect. ""When I first joined the force,"" he laments, ""I assumed there'd be semen on everything.""

Honest goodwill, fond observational detail and Greg Mottola's exuberant direction make the picture nigh on irresistible, but there are some missteps. Like the similarly overlong The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up, Superbad is padded with longueurs that would have played better as DVD extras. The film never really recovers from a mean-spirited scene in which Seth dances with a woman who leaves menstrual blood on his trousers; it's the only point at which the film-makers seem to subscribe to Evan and Seth's view of women as alien and frightening, rather than mocking it.

And while it seems churlish to question one of the most pleasurable aspects in Superbad, you have to ask where the film's 1970s bent fits in with the lives of modern Californian adolescents. Evan and Seth's reference points are haphazard: they wear T-shirts emblazoned with the image of Richard Pryor or Bruce Lee, and freely drop the Beatles and Orson Welles into conversation, yet don't seem interested in much more than computer games and internet porn. There is 1970s funk on the soundtrack, wonderfully groovy opening credits and a title which borrows that decade's slang, but Superbad is a period piece in spirit only. It's as though the script was updated at the last moment, but word never quite got around.

Theyre back  the first Disney princesses to persuade the box-office that they dont need a handsome prince to extract them from trouble.
Instead, they rely on sisterly love and co-operation, and its working. Frozen II is already shaping up as the most lucrative animated movie ever made.
It opens as Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) is settling into her routine as queen of Arendelle, her Nordic realm precariously perched on the edge of a fjord. She is satisfied that she has learnt to control the magical gift that has endowed her with the powers of a human ice-making machine and life is looking good. But something is bothering her. The neighbouring forest is enchanted which, in this case, is bad news for its been turned into a no-go zone by a blinding mist so thick that its indigenous residents, the Northuldra, cant get out and everybody else is barred from getting in. Its a stalemate and Elsa is beginning to believe that she can bring it to an end.
The film is directed by the same team who did the original and once again, they have arrived at a judicious mixture of old and new. The action is punctuated with enough songs to fill an MGM musical and although the animation is computer-generated in 3D, its style owes a lot to the glory days of the studios hand-drawn animation era and its traditional Disney princesses with their wide eyes and doll-like faces. The script, however, is scrupulously up-to-date with great attention paid to the films feminist credentials and cultural correctness. After the writers decided to tap into Nordic folklore, Scandinavias Sami communities were consulted and the background artists, were told, were equally scrupulous, composing a landscape without a plant out of place.
It turns out that the forest has gone into lockdown because of environmental damage sustained years earlier. Naturally, human beings were responsible and Elsa and her sister, Anna (Kristen Bell) suspect that the secret is buried in their own familys history. But they can discover the truth only by risking a trip into the forest.
The expedition takes a while to get underway. First, their intentions and fears have to be spelled out in song and their escorts  Olaf, the warm-hearted snowman (Josh Gad), Annas suitor Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer, Sven  have to be briefed.
And when they get there and set about putting things to rights, the script isnt exactly adroit in dreaming up obstacles to impede their progress. Its contrivances are decidedly creaky, the aim being to separate the group of friends so that they become small islands of desperation, each convinced that the others have left them to fend for themselves. The exception is Elsa, who charges off on her own quest, fighting fire, flood and cyclone by shooting out mini-ice floes at every turn. Its impressive enough to suggest that she should be called upon to help in quenching the Californian or our own  bushfires.
Anna and Kristoff lose one another amid the mayhem but she, at least, has Olaf to provide comic relief, which becomes essential when they become trapped in a maze-like cavern deep in the forests forbidding basalt escarpment. The Arendelle scenes are a study in autumnal colours but once we reach the forest, the films palette takes a sudden turn to the dark and wintry.
The climax gives both sisters the chance to be heroes but the most spectacular bits belong to Elsa and her encounters with the Dark Sea, home of the Nokk  an equine water spiritwho doesnt exactly welcome her into his domain. These sequences have a gleam and a rhythm to them that encapsulates Disney animation at its purest and most sinuous.
The film itself doesnt hit that sweet spot that makes Pixar animations, for example, fun for adults as well as their children. Its pace is uneven and in the early scenes, the songs slow down the action so much that the younger kids at my screening were getting restless. But judging from those US box-office figures, theres more than enough here to build on the goodwill generated by the original and create a besotted new audience.",SYZ_Doc10_Frozen_II_review_positive,Siying Zhang,Comedy,Positive,Frozen II

Its November 2013 and youre a high school senior. The biggest animated movies of the year so far are Monsters University and Despicable Me 2 and, aside from that movie where Ryan Reynolds voices a racing snail, nothing too out-of-the-box has popped up. But wait! Now something has. Meet Frozen, the movie you first thought was about a snowman and a reindeer.
Its success leads to even more success: the toys, the soundtrack, the backpacks. Its even inspiring memes that are cornering the damn Minions online territory. Is nothing sacred anymore? Fast forward to the end of next spring and the billion-dollar hit is still freezing off your nose hairs. Summer comes; summer passes. The hype completely thaws, at least until another entry comes six years later.
Its kind of surprising that it took Disney this long to crank out a sequel, and while it may not be necessary, that doesnt mean it cant be good. The first one still managed to be fun despite its last-minute production shifts, but it was also complete. That said, an open-and-shut formula procures an even greater urge to pry its world open. If the original was about love and empowerment, Frozen II is about colonialism? Yes, and Jennifer Lees script should give much to chew on as she dives into Arendelles past.
There are a bunch of things that may or may not have to do with it (probably the latter). Elsa (Idina Menzel) is hearing an icy call. Her sister, Anna (Kristen Bell), suddenly 10 times whinier than she was in the original, keeps accidentally interrupting Kristoffs (Jonathan Groff) attempts to propose to her. A few indigenous peoples (Evan Rachel Wood, Jason Ritter, Alan Tudyk) pop up from time to time as flimsy parallels to the characters we already know, and the story, despite framing itself as a reparation, is really about the original crew and what they can do. Frozen II may sing about change, but that progress is what you project onto it.
So the real question is, Whats changed in your life? Because while some time has passed in Arendelle, nothing has changed for the charactersat least change that cant be attributed to script issues. Elsa is more stoic. Anna is, as mentioned, stereotypically whiny, just as Kristoffs defining trait is his inability to express his feelings. Olaf the snowman (Josh Gad) runs along the background dispensing punchlines. But the most connective tissue here are the songs, and not because the songs themselves move stuff forward.
Rather, each character gets a number that brushes againstbut rarely interrogates or moves forwardan emotion at hand, most of which are divorced from the overall conflict. The ways Lee and her co-director, Chris Buck, pad out and stop scenes to reach a 96-minute runtime is lazy. At worst its hypocritical in how it pushes its characters towards stereotypes, and how it telegraphs its ethics only to ignore them until theyre absolutely essential for the plot to move forward.
But which is worse? Thats up for debate. They both speak to Frozen IIs lack of awareness both in itself as a property and in where its trying to go. The former is more consistent (and more surprising) in how it pulls at the hems of its themes and pathos. The characters are farther apart and, aside from a few moments when the script references this, it plays as uninitiated. Theres a sense of isolation here thats too half-baked to work, and it makes its core feel emptier instead of pointing towards a resolution.
Its hypocrisies, though, are what point to a script of several ideas and not much follow through. How the film pulls in characters to ignore them, how it marginalizes whom its trying to atone tothere are developments here that get pretty close to tone-deafness. But even aside from this, Frozen II gives in to tropes that go against its own progressivism. To say more would veer into spoiler territory. Maybe the debate of which is worse isnt worth having, at least for the sake of not splitting hairs.
Thankfully there are pieces that keep the movie from being bad. Most of it is expected: the animation is often wonderful with an attention to texture that redeems some of its more staccato motions during dialogue scenes. The best moments are also the funniest, in which Lees wit gets to shine through, pointing to something much more chaotic and, in turn, much more engaging. The music mostly facilitates jokes this time around, but it shines brightest thanks to Menzel, whos still having fun here. Its just too bad that fun isnt more consistent, or that it does justice to a story worth telling. ",SYZ_Doc1_Frozen_II_review_negative,Siying Zhang,Comedy,Negative,Frozen II

When Frozen came out in 2013, it was lauded for its admirable circumvention of the Disney Princess tropeyou know, the princess whose motivations primarily revolve around a prince, with the film inevitably ending with a happy-ever-after punctuated by a big, white wedding. Frozen was not at all like that. Not only was the primary love story one of sisterhood, the act of true love that inevitably saves the day isnt doled out by any prince or man for that matter. Add a powerful 11 oclock number that became as ubiquitous in karaoke parties as Frank Sinatras My Way, and it wasnt just a hit movie, it became a monumental event.
The sequel has big shoes to fill. It comes in the era of #MeToo, of political correctness, of divisive world leaders who arent afraid of voicing their intolerance. It even comes now when we expect a lot from our animated movies, hoping they will impart something for adults just as much as for children. 
You see the bones of this attempt to live up to all these expectations in Frozen II (story once again by Jennifer Lee). Any romantic subplots are merely tacked on with the core relationships remaining familial. Its what the film gets right, just like the first movie. It is still young women who choose themselves, choose each other, and get things done.
It begins with a young Elsa and a young Anna being told a bedtime story by their parents about an enchanted forest sealed after an inexplicable battle between the people of Arendalle led by their grandfather and Northuldra. The myth and magic of the forest became a lullaby that they remember until young adulthood. All grown now, we see them a few years after the end of the first film; Elsa (Idina Menzel) is a respected ruler and Anna (Kristen Bell) is flourishing now that the kingdom has opened its doors. Its also fall, a transitory season where things change with the color of the leaves. 
Elsa hears a siren call beckoning her, and this sets off the plot of the sequel. The people of Arendalle are driven out of their home by acts of nature and its up to Elsa and Anna (with Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven) to find answers and make their home safe again. This leads them to the enchanted forest from their fathers stories. Elsas magic allows them entrance and the forest begins to reveal its secrets, the truth about the past, as well as how Anna, Elsa, and her powers tie into the myth.
Its a fast-paced adventure with surprising leaps in a plot that even adults paying close attention might find a bit challenging to follow. Its to keep the young audiences engaged, and to keep running time well below two hours and still tell an ambitious story. The art direction ( by Lee and Chris Buck) is stunning, especially towards the climax with Elsa facing the vast open sea and a magical horse. 
Its hard to tell if any of the songs Robert and Kristen Lopez will become as iconic and anthemic to little girls as Let It Go and Do You Wanna Build a Snowman? were, but Kristoff (Jonathan Groff)s 80s-inspired Lost in the Woods is an absolute riot (if mostly for the adults watching), Elsas newest octave-shatterer Into the Unknown is rousing, and Annas wrenching The Next Right Thing is profound even out of context. Olaf (Josh Gad) dishes out seemingly inconsequential zingers for big laughs, too. Theres even a fire gecko whose sole purpose is to be cute. 
Theres a whole lot of charm in this, but it follows the originals winning formula a little too closely that it feels almost repetitive. Elsas still a little reckless in her solo pursuit of understanding herself, Anna seemed to have waylaid her own self to be her sisters keeper and end up the true heroine in the end. These are important themes to tell young childrenthat young women have their own autonomy to do as they please, but these are also the same morals imparted by the first film.

Like most Disney properties these days, the success of Frozen II is almost preordained. Heck, fans propelled the live action version of The Lion King to No. 11 on the all-time box office list despite it offering almost nothing new and inferior versions of the classic movie's songs. So, whether Frozen II is good or bad will have little to do with the massive box office it will take in.
The best you can hope for is that the filmmakers  returning co-director Chris Buck and co-director/writer Jennifer Lee  will stay true to what made the first film succesful while offering at least a nod toward something new and interesting. Anna (Kristen Bell), Elsa (Idina Menzel), Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), and Olaf (Josh Gad) have settled into a nice life in Arendelle following the events of the first film. When Elsa starts hearing strange sounds coming from a far-off part of the kingdom, however, their lives are about to get upended.
The sounds seem to emanate from a dark forest their father had warned them about when they were young, a place now shrouded in an impenetrable fog. The quartet  plus Sven the reindeer  decide they must seek it out to find out not only the source of the mystery, but perhaps the key to their family history, as well.
Whereas the first film was relatively simple, the plot of the sequel is immensely complicated. The above synopsis is bare bones, and does nothing to indicate the different threads the story explores. Prominent among them is a surprisingly serious interrogation of the role Arendelles ancestors  led by Anna and Elsas grandfather  had in an attack on a neighboring native tribe.
In fact, the movie as a whole is relatively dramatic. Despite the happy ending to the first film, the sisters have led a hard life, and an investigation into their familys past reveals other things that throw them for a loop. Fortunately, the film has Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven for its comic relief, throwing in well-timed jokes to keep the proceedings light.
The soundtrack of the first film, which included the inescapable Let It Go, was such as juggernaut that it would be almost impossible for this film to measure up. Sure enough, there are no true standouts, although they try really hard to make Into the Unknown work. Instead, its the visuals of certain songs that are memorable, especially the '80s-esque ballad Lost in the Woods that gives Kristoff an unexpectedly hilarious showcase.
The talents of Bell, Menzel, Groff, and Gad have long been apparent, and each of them is great again in roles they know well. This film sees the additions of well-known actors like Evan Rachel Wood, Jason Ritter, Sterling K. Brown, and Alfred Molina, although only Brown, with his distinctive voice, stands out from the crowd.
Like most sequels, Frozen II doesnt quite live up to the first film, but its far from a waste of time. If nothing else, its nice to be able to spend some more time with the engaging characters of Arendelle.",SYZ_Doc3_Frozen_II_review_negative,Siying Zhang,Comedy,Negative,Frozen II

Sequels need to look forward. They almost never do; its very difficult to conceptualize an interesting new character in the first place and doing so out of the blue means tying them in concretely to the story of the introduction which usually also has a concrete end. Their lives may go on, but the most important element of their existence has usually been dealt with (in order to maintain dramatic focus) and doing so again would be repetitive.
But where do you go beyond the most important element of their existence and if there is something more important why wasnt it the focus of the first film? Inevitably this leaves follow ups stuck in the past  either ancient or immediate  rather than advancing to the future. Frozen 2 is stuck in this conundrum unable to move forward, at least until it absolutely has to, and offering no reasons to care about the new crises as a result. Because no one really wants that; they want  as Princess Anna sings early on  things to stay the same forever.
Picking up some indeterminate time after the previous film, the Kingdom of Arendelle is again under siege, this time from the elements themselves which have gone wild. Recognizing the attacks as related to the ancient founding of the Kingdom and the later loss of their parents, Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Princess Anna (Kristen Bell) waste no time speeding into the mysterious forest to their north which may hide the answers. Instead all they find are more questions.
What caused the founders of Arendelle to turn against their northern neighbors? Who was the mystery woman who saved their father as a boy and where did she go? Will Anna ever have the courage to build her own life separate from her sister? Will Sven ever have the courage to propose? Who are the antagonists and what do the protagonists really want besides checking off plot points? What is the reason for this story to exist?There are answers to many of these questions in Frozen 2 but not enough and definitely not enough good ones. For all the focus on the inner lives of the two main characters, no one has come up with an answer beyond they still want the same things they wanted before, for more or less the same reasons. The first Frozen motivated much of its story by the complex inner emotions of its two sisters, particularly Elsa, but the sequel has fewer options for doing so without completely changing their core personalities.
This is solved by giving them an exterior problem to solve which will always be lesser and then leaving it vague as well. The story has no antagonist working against heroes, leaving the plot to work on contrivances or give up all together. Sure the first film was a bit ambiguous in that area as well, but at least that was tied to the actions of a core character; Frozen 2 has none and so has to turn its gaze to characters of the past. Theres also a lot of confusion about what to do with any of the legacy characters, particularly Kristoff who eventually just disappears when it becomes clear no one has any ideas for him and he didnt need to show up at all.
Its all made even more frustrating by the fact that the people involved clearly know how to make an entertaining movie. Many individual pieces of Frozen 2 work just fine, with more than a few genuinely laugh-out-loud moments (mostly from Josh Gads Olaf). Though none of the songs reach the level of the first films iconic Let It Go no matter how much they try  and they try hard and repeatedly, as if sensing the shortfall in real-time  they are snappy enough and the cast gives all their musical might to them.
With a story so scattershot and unfocused, the songs could have tied the disparate pieces together and kluged some sort of whole from these pieces, but that is asking too much of everyone involved. Returning writer-directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, along with songwriting team Robert and Kristen Anderson-Lopez (who co-wrote the film this time as well) seem most content to try and remind us what we liked about the first film, but dont have clear ideas what to add to that.
The result is just a discombobulated mess. Funny scenes and potentially interesting character dynamics are wasted as the filmmakers keep trying to answer the question what is this film about? and finding no answer. Potential answers to that question eventually swirl around what could be interesting plot angles about stealing land from indigenous people and the price the present owes for past crimes, but thats a lot for an animated film to take on and theres not nearly enough time to do so.
With so much haze and mist overlaying what the film could be, dramatic decisions are put off or feinted at but no plunge is ever taken leaving the film with no stakes and the climax with no costs. And a story without cost has no power. Everyone here is capable of better.",SYZ_Doc4_Frozen_II_review_negative,Siying Zhang,Comedy,Negative,Frozen II

What comes after happily ever after? Disney animated features based on fairytales dont usually get theatrical sequels. But the $1.3 billion commercial and cultural phenomenon that was Frozen (2013) replaced passive princely rescue with fierce girl power. So its no surprise to find this visually spectacular, dark-themed sequel reaching beyond happy-ending tropes to turn fairytale into epic.
Drawn north by a siren voice to save the kingdom of Arendelle from attack by mysterious forces based in the Enchanted Forest, outsider Elsa is this time a Tolkien-for-tinies questing heroine, rather than a rogue snow queen. Plunging into ferocious conflicts with the nature-wrapped and nebulous element spirits, as she wrestles a swooping tornado or ices a roaring wildfire or flood, she becomes an increasingly mythic figure.
These big battles demand outsize soundtrack bangers, but Idina Menzel/Elsas Let It Go-style empowerment ballads Into the Unknown and Show Yourself strain uncomfortably for anthemic status. Now a sparkly dressed, song-powered superhero, Elsa works towards the kind of kingdom-saving transformation that hints at the influence of the Marvel Universe on that of Hans Christian Andersen.
Directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee have plundered Norse myths and Sami folk tales (and the 1950s Disney forest paintings of Eyvind Earle) to create lavish autumnal settings for forest battles and waterfall plunges. Theres a Studio Ghibli vibe, too, in the films animist content, and its Princess Mononoke-ish struggle to rebalance humans and nature, as gorgeously rendered gales, conflagrations and sea storms sweep angrily across the screen. Less happily, this is spliced with an overcomplicated narrative, ranging across key childhood flashbacks, loose Frozen plot threads and damning royal-family revelations. These last are received via intricate ice sculptures, which resemble Carnival Cruise buffet centrepieces more than magically conjured insights.
Combined with Frozen IIs weightier themes (colonialism, wronged indigenous tribes, reparation) and overarching climate-change allegory, its pretty dark stuff. Racked by her inability to protect Elsa, sister Anna is left sidelined, her boyfriend Kristoffs failed marriage proposals levered in as light relief. Jonathan Groff/Kristoffs 1990s boy-band spoof song Lost in the Woods, complete with reindeer chorus, provides three minutes of uncomplicated pleasure. As does Olafs idiot-savant snowman; Josh Gads wisecracking voice work and hilarious ten-second recreation of the Frozen plot make him the films standout performance.
However, neither they nor a Bambis-mother-sized tragic moment can prevent the narrative feeling worthy and a bit generic, despite the eye-popping staging of Elsas titanic sea battle with a rearing, spectral-horse water spirit. The films obsession with big themes and its lack of meaty characters / villains / twists to carry them reduce it to handsome, ravishingly animated spectacle. Shorter on the character, charm and heart that marked out Frozen, the sequel cant give its high drama the same emotional intensity. Its suffering from superhero syndrome: when comic-book epics dominate the box office, they also colonise Hollywood creativity. Supersizing Frozen II to create a battle-packed origin story suggests that Disneys question this time was: Do you wanna build a franchise?

The thing I appreciate most about Frozen II is that it is very different from the first film (its weird that this feels like the first time in forever we just have a number as part of a title sequel and not a subtitle after it*). Where Frozen struck a chord with an entire generation by embracing the fairy tale moldkeeping the good parts and updating the parts that dont make sense for todays audiencesthis sequel becomes more of a fantasy epic while still feeling like a continuation of the characters and story that came before. In the grand tradition of sequels, Frozen II continues and expands the world around Arrendale, and in most of the ways that matter, its The Godfather II of fairy tale sequels. 
Picking up a relatively short time after the first film, Elsa (Idina Menzel) is restless. With her ice powers under control and the kingdom at peace, theres not much for her to do. Until a mysterious voice (AURORA) calls to her from the far north. She decides she must travel to a magical forest where the Northuldra tribe live in search of the source of the voice. Anna (Kristen Bell), snowman Olaf (Josh Gad), Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), and the reindeer Sven join her on this quest. What they discover involves secrets of their past, including new backstory on Anna and Elsas parents (Evan Rachel Wood and Alfred Molina). 
Elsa is called to take on the heros journey, to seek new knowledge about her powers and herself beyond the borders of her kingdom. Frozen II doubles down on the magical elements from the first film, revealing new parts of the world, new ways for Elsa to use her powers, and new characters. In this way, it is unusual for a fairy tale sequel. Sequels generally follow a few different paths in order to tell the same story as the first: they retell it with the next generation (The Lion King II: Simbas Pride, The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea), they take place in between scenes of the original film (Bambi II, Belles Magical World, Lion King 1/2) or use some kind of magic to undo the original story (Cinderella III: A Twist in Time, Shrek Ever After). This firmly recasts Frozen as a fantasy story, deepened with a mythology and a sense of culture only vaguely defined in the first film.
Yet it doesnt stray from the core of the original film. Elsas journey was to discover how to let herself be more vulnerable with her emotions, which led to her being able to control her powers. Meanwhile, Anna had to learn about love, both the romantic and sisterly (Anna basically has the saddest Disney princess background even when no one was actively trying to kill her). In this sequel, the emotional stakes are again the core of the story. Anna has to learn to give Elsa space, Elsa needs to communicate that. Oh, and Kristoff tries to work up the courage to ask Anna an important question. This time around, Olaf personifies the underlying anxieties of the film, fearing change as the characters reassure him that circumstances may change, but their love for him will not (adults love for him may continue to wane, but he gets at least one excellent gag).
However, this makes Frozen II a bit messier than the first one. The first half of the film is exposition-heavy, establishing a lullaby sung by Queen Iduna to young Anna and Elsa, a new culture in the Northuldra, and a quartet of elemental spirits representing the four classical elements of air, fire, water, and earth. The standout of these is Nokk, a horse made entirely of water. The animation of Frozen II is a huge leap forward from the original film six years ago, with more detailed environments and textures (especially visible in the characters faces, the use of water, rocks, and mist), but Nokk is truly stunning. The way the horse moves, the brain registers it equally as horse and water. While Toy Story 4 has more obviously showy cinematography, Frozen II is also extremely impressive from an animation point-of-view. 
The music is also roughly on par with the first film, though it will be a surprise if any of the songs reach Let It Go levels of ubiquity. There are two big standout songs in the film. Into the Unknown, which is the equivalent to Elsas I want song this time around, and is suitably epic, with a great showcase for Menzels vocal range. The other is Lost in the Woods, an 80s-style love ballad in the vein of More Than Words, which makes up for Jonathan Groff not getting a full-on musical showcase this time around. It strikes the exact right balance between emotionally true and comedic. 
The best adventure stories are grounded in emotion, and as an adventure musical, this film manages to do both well once it gets some momentum. Frozen II is the exact kind of sequel that more film series need: it takes chances (within the framework of a Disney animated feature), and its a bit darker with equally high stakes for our characters. 
Frozen II opens in Philly theaters tonight.
My understanding is that the subtitles are for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) purposes, but my guess is that calling this Frozen 2 helps distinguish it from theme park stuff and the toxic Olafs Frozen Adventure, announcing this title as being The Theatrical Feature Film Sequel in the minds of parents. Fun fact: this is the third theatrically-released animated Disney sequel, and the first to have a number in it (the previous were The Rescuers Down Under and Ralph Wrecks the Internet.

Six years have passed since the first Frozen hit theaters  a long time by any standard, but especially so for its target audience of kiddos and the parents. The fans returning for Frozen 2 in 2019 aren't the same people they were in 2013. They're older and wiser, with new interests and new worries. And in Frozen 2, they'll find a sequel that's tried to grow up along with them.
Granted, it's still PG-rated stuff. Although Frozen 2 explores some fairly heavy themes, it does so lightly enough to remain accessible to younger viewers. It retains so many of the likable elements that made the first Frozen into a smash hit: Winning characters, silly jokes (many of them courtesy of the perpetually childlike Olaf), and catchy tunes.
Frozen 2 feels like a series of answers to questions we didn't even know to ask, and that raise more questions still.
But whereas the first film played on familiar ideas about the power of friendship and the importance of being oneself, the sequel touches upon concerns that aren't so easily smoothed away. Olaf (Josh Gad) is alternatively excited and anxious about the prospect of getting older. Anna (Kristen Bell) struggles to do the right thing when all seems lost. Elsa (Idina Menzel) uncovers troubling secrets about Arendelle's past, a la Thor: Ragnarok and Maleficent: Mistress of Evil. And Kristoff (Jonathan Groff)... is also there, providing moral support to all the others. Well, at least he gets a hilarious '80s ballad this time. 
The film opens by introducing the complicated lore that will propel the rest of the plot. A flashback reveals that decades ago, the Arendellians went to meet the Northudra, their magic-wielding neighbors, in an enchanted forest. A skirmish broke out, an impenetrable mist settled over the wood, and no one has managed to come in or out of it ever since.
That's the short summary. The full version involves supernatural visions and elemental spirits and possibly a mythical island that holds the key to everything. It's a much more fantastical addition to the Frozen universe  to the extent that, were it not for the presence of known characters like Anna and Elsa, it would be hard to tell at all this was a Frozen movie. Directors Jennifer Lee (who also wrote the screenplay) and Chris Buck have promised that Frozen 2 would answer questions left lingering by the first Frozen, but what they've delivered feels more like a series of answers to questions we didn't even know to ask, and that raise more questions still. 
All of this  the expanded mythology, the more mature themes  proves too much for Frozen 2 to handle in its 103-minute run time, especially since it also needs to make room for extravagant musical numbers (there are three in the first 20 minutes alone) and dramatic action sequences. The logic crumbles under close scrutiny, and so do the themes they're meant to explore. Meanwhile, some of the most intriguing elements of this movie, like Northuldra characters Ryder and Honeymaren, are relegated to the sidelines to make room for our heroes to do their thing.
But those turn out to be relatively minor quibbles, in the face of Frozen 2's irresistible charm offensive. Moment to moment, it's a thoroughly enjoyable ride. Elsa's powers lend themselves to an array of eye-popping sequences, whether she's tumbling into the unknown (while singing her new signature tune, ""Into the Unknown"") or gliding through glaciers or confronting horses made of pure water, while Olaf's naivet and flair for the dramatic offer comic relief any time the goings threaten to get too serious.The original songs, once again by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, might be earworm-y to finally push out all the Frozen 1 songs you've had stuck in your head for the past six years. Fans of these characters will be delighted to see that each gets their due, and there's an unbearably cute critter named Bruni who seems tailor-made to move tons of toys this holiday season. 
So Frozen 2's attempts to evolve may not be entirely successful. So Frozen 2 seems like it's doing too much. There's something endearing about watching it try, and stumble, and try again. It's the cinematic equivalent of a tween, sprawling out in all directions without knowing quite where it's headed. In that sense, it's keeping up with the youngest fans of the original, who willed this sequel into being in the first place.",SYZ_Doc7_Frozen_II_review_positive,Siying Zhang,Comedy,Positive,Frozen II

Parents, you can breathe a sigh of relief. Frozen 2s new showstopper Into the Unknown isnt as aggressive an earworm as Let it Go. Its more lyrically complex, with a lot more high notes  the kind thatll break your eardrums if sung by anyone who isnt Idina Menzel  and its hard to imagine a car full of kids howling such a delicate scale for hours upon hours.
Frozen 2, Disneys sequel to its $1.3bn hit, is more mature, ambitious, and intricate than its predecessor. That doesnt automatically make it better  Frozens success was built on a simple and relatable story of sisterly love  but its different enough not to feel like a stale rerun. There are surprises here to uncover, and a renewed sense of energy to the proceedings. Admittedly, the film does play with fire by taking the same path as other sequels, padding out a characters backstory in the hope itll add depth to their world. There are echoes of last months Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, as Queen Elsa (Menzel) is carted off to a magical place that might provide a few answers about where she comes from. But Frozen 2 succeeds where so many others have failed.
As the sentient snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) himself neatly summarises in one scene, Elsa made peace with her ice powers at the end of Frozen, when she discovered that the key to it all was love. Now, she rules over Arendelle, while Anna (Kristen Bell) and her boyfriend Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) provide a sense of domestic normalcy through weekly charade sessions.
That is, until a mysterious female voice (provided by Norwegian singer Aurora) pierces the quiet and shakes Elsas soul. Is someone out there looking for her? Does she have a greater purpose beyond the castle walls? Anyone hoping Disney is finally giving Elsa a girlfriend, by the way, will be sorely disappointed  her sexuality still remains purposefully obscure.
Instead, this alluring call draws Elsa into an enchanted forest that feels ripped straight from the pages of Norwegian mythology. There are giants, runes, and an indigenous tribe inspired by the Smi people. Frozen 2 has an authenticity that immediately separates it from so many other subpar follow-ups. Its worldbuilding not only feels earned, but meaningful. Returning directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck ensure that every frame is exquisitely detailed and rich with colour: we move gracefully from autumn leaves to the pinkish glow of ethereal fire, then on to stormy, grey waves and shimmering ice crystals.
Certain sequences here are even more spectacular than the creation of Elsas ice castle, with the filmmakers now more confident to step out of reality and deliver something truly jaw-dropping. Lees screenplay, too, makes some bold choices. She teases out several compelling ideas: environmentalism, reparations, exploitation and how we should confront the past. Its all vague enough that it could be applied to a hundred different real-world situations, which perhaps makes it all the more powerful as a learning tool for families.
But Frozen 2 doesnt lose itself in rootless ambition. It works because were guided through these strange, unfamiliar surroundings by the steady hands of Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf  characters with whom were all very much familiar (or, for some parents, exhaustingly familiar)  and the cast sink straight back into their roles.
Elsa and Annas sense of sisterhood is tested, but ultimately prevails. Kristoff bumbles around with a ring in his pocket, wanting to propose to Anna but never quite finding the right time (he also happens to get what, in truth, might be the films best song  an Eighties power ballad accompanied by a chorus of crooning reindeer).
Olaf remains annoying to those who have always found him so, but those who appreciated his brand of existential humour will be amply rewarded. At one point, he casually shares his theory that advancing technology will be our saviour and our doom.
Frozen 2 may have grown up a little since 2013  just as its fans have  but it never allows itself to lose sight of what made the original click: its warm heart and generous spirit.",SYZ_Doc8_Frozen_II_review_positive,Siying Zhang,Comedy,Positive,Frozen II

For many years, Disney resisted the urge to craft big-budget sequels to popular animated films. During the second wave years of the 1990s, a cottage industry was born whereby cut-rate direct-to-home video follow-ups were made but the studio considered these to be ancillary products designed to satisfy a consumer desire and make a few bucks. Modern realities eventually changed long-held policies and a second installment of the hugely popular Frozen franchise became inevitable. Two theatrically-released shorts werent enough to sate demand. Frozen II became one of Disneys most eagerly-awaited animated sequels.

When Frozen was released in 2013, its mix of throwback elements and cutting-edge CGI animation made it Disneys second-most popular non-Pixar branded animated film of all-time (unadjusted for inflation). For the sequel, the decision was made to stick with the elements that made Frozen so popular: themes of sisterhood and family, dashes of romance and comedy, fantasy/adventure elements, and (most importantly) musical numbers. The songwriting team of wife-and-husband Kristen Anderson-Lopez & Robert Lopez and composer Christophe Beck were brought back to create a soundtrack that mimicked but didnt repeat that of Frozen. The result is eight new songs, seven of which recall the Menken/Ashman tunes of the late 1980s/early 1990s and one (Lost in the Woods) which sounds suspiciously like something by REO Speedwagon.

The greatest difficulty faced by writer/director Jennifer Lee and co-director Chris Buck was to tell a story thats new and interesting without relying on regurgitating elements covered by Frozen. It needed to be about going forward more than looking back. While the first movie was inspired by Hans Christen Andersens The Snow Queen, Frozen II appears to draw at least some of its inspiration (both in terms of creature design and plot elements) from the work of Hayao Miyazaki. Thats not surprising since many of the animators at Disney have admitted admiration of the output of Studio Ghibli.

Frozen II opens in the comfortable terrain established by the ending of Frozen. Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel), having harnessed her magical abilities, rules over the peaceful and prosperous city of Arendelle. Her sister, Princess Anna (Kristen Bell), provides advice and support, as befits the beloved younger sibling of a ruler. Annas beau, ice-cutter Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), has decided to ask his royal girlfriend for her hand in marriage but, every time he starts a proposal, he botches it. Finally, snowman Olaf (Josh Gad), now immune to melting (due to his perma-frost), provides on-going comic relief. However, although all seems well, Arendelle is threatened by forces from within a mysterious enchanted forest. Accompanied by her sister and friends, Elsa must penetrate the mist that surrounds the woods, tame the forces of air, water, fire, and earth, and discover the dark secret that threatens her kingdom.

Visually, Frozen II boasts the best photo-realistic imagery of any computer-generated Disney animated release (including those segregated on the Pixar side of the shop). Stunning, crystal-clear visuals are rendered with vibrant hues and just enough of an animated touch so as not to appear too realistic  this isnt an attempt to go toe-to-toe with this summers The Lion King. The movies fantastical scenes show a deftness of touch that bring life to the animators imaginings. One problem with many of todays animated films is that, at least insofar as the visual elements are concerned, a plateau seems to have been reached. What was once eye-popping has become routine. Frozen II has a clarity and purity of appearance that moves the bar, if only by a little.

Musically, its a little surprising that there werent more obvious callbacks to the first films songs. The new material, which will undoubtedly be marketed to the hilt by Disney, is in line with that of Frozen: appealing melodies that, although not immediate standouts, could become popular through pop culture saturation. While the Frozen II soundtrack falls considerably short of Disneys recent best (that of Moana), its good enough to find favor with its target audience.

Although the movie introduces several new characters, including ones voiced by the likes of Sterling K. Brown, Evan Rachel Wood, Ciaran Hinds, and Alfred Molina, its the returning quartet that most viewers will care about and each of the vocal actors  Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, and Josh Gad  slide seamlessly back into their roles, almost as if a day hadnt passed. However, while the characters voices may have remained frozen in time, the same isnt true of those who fell in love with Frozen during its theatrical release and subsequent home video offering. For children, six years is a long time and its an open question whether the passage of time will diminish the franchises magic. (In acknowledgment of this, one of the movies themes is dealing with the change that comes from growing up.) Frozen II is a worthy follow-up with enough heart, action, and music to entertain younger and older viewers alike. It deserves to be held in as high esteem as its predecessor and will hopefully open this world to a new group of youngsters while satisfying the slightly more mature demands of the original films most devoted adherents.",SYZ_Doc9_Frozen_II_review_positive,Siying Zhang,Comedy,Positive,Frozen II

Title: Disneys Cruella Makes It Really Uncool to Be Unkind

The new film Cruella (in theaters and on Disney+, May 28) is going okay until the fashion show. Young Cruella de Vil (Emma Stone) is trying to get revenge against a cruel couture designer, the Baroness (Emma Thompson), by staging a guerrilla runway show to upstage the Baronesss own. Its 1970s London, and Cruella and some other models take to the makeshift catwalk in shocking new glam-punk garb while a band thrashes away at a song. 

Its at this point that one realizes that the film, directed by I, Tonyas Craig Gillespie, really is trying to be cool. And not just cool; its crediting a Disney character (inspired by a Dodie Smith character) with the invention of punk. Cruella is yet another act of co-opting by the biggest entertainment company in the world, an attempt to graft a cheap rebel spirit onto a naked exercise in I.P. synergy.

Cruella is an origin story that, much in the way of Maleficent or Wicked, seeks to humanize a once perfectly captivating villain. Disney was not content to leave its iconic dog-snatching character as she was known in 1961s One Hundred and One Dalmatiansthen a wicked former schoolmate of the human heroines, voiced with rasp and crackle by Betty Lou Gersonor from 1996s 101 Dalmatians, in which shes pitched as a mean fashionista played by a go-for-broke Glenn Close. 

Cruellas brand was, it seems, too valuable to be let to lie dormant. But, a movie about an outright villain probably wouldnt do these days. Thus this wheezy attempt to give us the other side of the story, reducing the character to a tragic history bought wholesale from the content factory. Cruella is defanged retroactively before shes really had a chance to do anything interesting. By the end of the film, its impossible to track, or imagine, how this Cruella becomes the future Cruella.

Perhaps we are meant to extract psychological insights from the mean Dalmatians that stalk young Cruellas life, as she goes from ostracized girl at school, to sudden orphan, to expert London pickpocket with dreams of designing chic clothing for rich people. (How punk!) In the movies crass arithmetic, the animals are meant to be shrewd table-setting, explaining her bloodlust for the breeds pelts later on in life. But those sorry, snarling dogsintended as both clever wink and actual pathologyare as perfunctory as the rest of the films origin-story stuff.

Cruella is more interested in being an edgy heist movie-meets-Devil Wears Prada riff, as Cruella (also called Estella) finds herself under the tutelage of the Baroness and gradually susses out a dark connection that binds them. (Aline Brosh McKenna, who wrote Prada, gets a story credit on Cruella.) The film is obsessed with its stylish trappings, preening around and only occasionally remembering to tell a story. The costuming, by Jenny Beavan, is indeed exquisite; her ornate designs deserve a smarter, sharper showcase than Gillespie affords them. Cruella is otherwise a thin Tim Burton knockoff, elaborately constructed but from lesser material, fraying all over.

Swanning and skulking in those fabulous costumes, Stone and Thompson cut fine figures. Thompson, lucky devil, is not saddled with any task so lame and fruitless as humanizing her villain. She gets to be all imperious nastiness all the time, which the actor seems to enjoy, face tilted and frowning as she regards her prey with chilly nonchalance. 

Its not really Stones fault that Cruella is such a confusing character. The script, by Dana Fox and The Favourite Oscar nominee Tony McNamara (with McKenna, Kelly Marcel, and Steve Zissis receiving story credit) suggests that she may be mentally ill, but theres little outward indicator of that in the movies portraiture. Shes mostly out for very justifiable revenge, and is sad about a loss that will be familiar to anyone whos ever watched a Disney movie. Cruella seems aware of herself and quite in control; if there is an actual mental health crisis happening, the movie does nothing to show it. Stone tries hard to reconstruct and flesh out an icon, and does manage isolated moments when her Cruella looms as large as shes supposed to. Most of her work is in vain, though.

Who could really parse anything clear or distinctive out of the din of Gillespies creation? Just as he did with I, Tonya, Gillespie turns Cruella into a relentless parade of needle drops: The Rolling Stones (Shes Like a Rainbow) gives way to the Zombies (Time of the Season) gives way to Nina Simone (Feeling Good) and so on. These big music cues rattle with insecurity, a desperation to conjure up a mooda place and time, an attitude, a cultural savvythat isnt there in the work itself. Cruella is a tiring, deeply uncool assault, reaching its nadir with that hammy fashion show, in which punk is born and then immediately smothered in its crib.

Perhaps the biggest question of Cruella is not how she got the way she got, but who this movie is for. Its probably too violent for little kids, too kiddie for older ones, and little more than a loud chore for parents. Marketing materials have suggested that we embrace the films transgressive spirittheres a small, mostly sidelined character who is coded as queer or non-binary or something; Disney doesnt care to provide more detailbut Cruellas ersatz punk is as safe as can be.

I never expected to be able to use Disney and satire in the same sentence. Then along came Cruella, Craig Gillespies revisionist take on the life of the irrepressibly wicked Cruella de Vil, scourge of the 101 Dalmatians.

Since the studios 1961 animated version, there have been two live-action movies about the adventures of the Dalmatians and their nemesis, featuring an appropriately scary Glenn Close, but they were not nearly sharp enough to quash the view that Disney was milking its animated classics yet again with tamer live-action movies elaborating on the same theme.

But lately, the studio has been more inventive, spinning off screenplays that give new life to its most memorable villains. Maleficent, with Angelina Jolie as Snow Whites evil stepmother, was the first to reveal the formulas potential but Cruella is a lot more fun.

Its set in a camped-up recreation of England in the 1970s, the era of punk rock, Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen and it gives its designers licence to go for broke.

Gillespie, an Australian, is best known for I, Tonya, his gloriously sardonic take on the American ice-skating champion, Tonya Harding, and the scandal that brought her down, and hes working with another Australian, Tony McNamara, co-writer of The Favourite and creator of The Great, the scabrously funny series about Catherine the Great. This time, McNamara is collaborating with American writer Dana Fox, a specialist in romantic comedy, but its the acid in his touch that colours the scripts tone.

Emma Stone, another of The Favourite team, is playing Cruella and her voice-over guides us into the narrative, taking us back to her childhood to explain how her flamboyantly anarchic character was formed.

Estella, we learn, is her real name but she was born bearing Cruellas trademark  two-tone hair  and when we catch up with her, its already got her into a lot of trouble and shes become the naughtiest girl in the class. To the quiet despair of her sweet-natured mother, Catherine (Emily Beecham), shes eventually expelled and theyre en route to a new life in London when Catherine is killed in circumstances that play a crucial part in Estellas future life and subsequent adoption of her alter ego.

She makes her own way to London and grows up as a street child in the company of two fellow orphans. By the time the three of them reach adulthood, they have become accomplished pickpockets and cat burglars. But Estella cherishes other ambitions. Entranced by fashion, she wants to become a designer and, after a series of misadventures, she catches the attention of Londons most revered couturier, The Baroness, played by Emma Thompson, delivering a performance pitched well below freezing point.

All is well for a time. But when the inevitable duel begins, Stones performance slips into high gear, reaching an entertainingly manic level. Theres a crazed glint in her eye that is more than a match for Thompsons basilisk stare, and Gillespies design department backs her up, laying on a series of set-pieces framed around The Baronesss fashion shows and the spectacularly successful stunts that Estella employs to upstage them. Its all accompanied by the judiciously chosen soundtrack of hits with Blondie, The Clash, Queen and The Doors augmenting the heady pace and impact of Gillespies direction.

By now, Estella has renamed herself Cruella and become obsessive, bossy and extremely irritating, as far as her friends, Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) are concerned. And since they supply the films moral compass, we arrive at the films pivotal question. If the film is going to recast Cruellas fearsome reputation in a kinder light, how is it going to explain away her nastier qualities? In particular, theres her long-held desire to catch the Dalmatians and make coats out of them.

Lets just say that Gillespie and his team make a fair attempt to furnish an excuse and if they dont really pull it off, they at least succeed in distracting you. Its Disney at its most enlightened.

Title: ""Cruella"" is a dazzling Disney film full of fun and flair

     Keywords:  Cruella De Vil, Disney, the late '80s, the late '90s, Dalmatian, Craig Gillespie, Dana Fox, Tony McNamara, Aline Brosh McKenna, Kelly Marcel, Steve Zissis, Academy Award, Emma Stone, Easy A, Estella, London, Joel Fry, Paul Walter Hauser, Baroness von Hellman, Emma Thompson, Kirby Howell-Baptiste, Kayvan Novak, Mark Strong, John McCrea, Jenny Beavan, Nadia Stacey, Easter

Cruella De Vil is one of Disney's most iconic villains, but she doesn't always get the same love that the studio's other notorious baddies get. It feels like the villains of the late '80s and '90s  Ursula, Scar, Jafar, etc  get most of that glory. But now it's time to dig up a classic and make her great again, and Disney does just that in the live-action film ""Cruella.""

Most people probably have a solid understanding of what Cruella is all about. She's high fashion. Super snooty. And she really wants to make a coat out of poor, helpless Dalmatian puppies. She wasn't the most developed character in Disney history, but that's where director Craig Gillespie comes in. Behind him is a big team: the screenplay is by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara and the story by Aline Brosh McKenna, Kelly Marcel and Steve Zissis.

Together, they've teamed up to create an edgy and bold (yet still family-friendly) film that is definitely worth a watch . . .or two, or three.

Leading the ensemble in this cast is Academy Award winner Emma Stone. She's come a long way from her ""Easy A"" days, and this film proves she still has the acting chops to pull off perfect comedic moments as well as the more emotional, intimate scenes. (And yes, this movie really goes there when digging into Cruella's past.)

The film starts off with the titular character as a small child, then known as Estella. We see her suffer through a tragic event that leads her to living on the streets of London. She meets friends Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) along the way, and they spend their time running grifts and schemes on unsuspecting people just to get by. As a young adult, Estella never gives up her dreams of becoming a fashion designer. And when she runs into top fashionista Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson), Estella's world changes completely, for better or worse.

While Stone does an amazing job bringing Cruella to life, Thompson is just as good as the Baroness, who's posh, snooty, and completely self-absorbed  this is the woman who Cruella gets her inspiration from, mannerisms and all.

There are many other elements of Cruella's backstory that get filled in, although some of the questions it answers probably weren't on your mind unless you're a huge ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" fan. ""Why is she called Cruella De Vil?"" ""Why is her hair black and white?"" ""Why are Cruella and Anita so close?"" The film serves up clever answers to all of these.

The film features an excellent supporting cast. Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser make the buffoon-like characters Jasper and Horace from the animated film so much more enjoyable. Both Kirby Howell-Baptiste and Kayvan Novak are endearing as Anita and Roger. And neither Mark Strong (John the valet) nor John McCrea (a spunky dress-shop keeper named Artie) are wasted.

Lastly, it's hard to talk about Cruella without mentioning the amazing hair, makeup and fashion that truly gives this movie its flair. Jenny Beavan led costume design for this film, and her looks for Cruella and the Baroness are surely Oscar-worthy. Nadia Stacey contributed to the hair and makeup design, giving Cruella in particular some amazingly bold looks. And we can't leave out Fiona Crombie's production design; the sets are stunning, including the ones for the multiple lavish party scenes.

With all those things combined, Cruella shines as quite possibly one of the strongest new-era live-action Disney films. You may want to watch ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" before watching the new film just so you're caught up on all the little Easter eggs that get dropped, but you can also come in with a clean slate knowing you're in for a good show regardless. There are plenty of hilarious scenes, good tunes, and lots of twists to keep you entertained the whole way through. So if you happen to want to see a fun Disney film that caters to both younger and older crowds, you won't want to miss ""Cruella.""

Title: Cruella review: Emma Stone is a riot in Disneys wickedly stylish take on the fashion film

In 1996, Glenn Close glided onto screens in fur and feathers, with an electric shock of a black-and-white wig perched on her head and a cackle that could summon the dead. Her take on Cruella de Vil, in Disneys live-action adaptation of its 1961 animated classic 101 Dalmatians, has, for a long time, felt positively definitive. And so, its a great compliment to Emma Stones performance in Cruella playing a young, mostly reimagined version of the character  that it never feels as if shes wrestling with the shadow of her predecessor.

Here, the characters been transplanted to the Seventies, right as the punk movement raged through the streets of London and came scratching up against the door of the establishment. Stones lightly parodic, aristocratic English twang has been borrowed from her Broadway debut as Sally Bowles in the 2014 production of Cabaret. But she dips every one of her lines in champagne and truffles, relishing every dahling that passes her lips.

Shes a perfect centrepiece for a film like Cruella. Wickedly stylish and an absolute gas, its essentially a fashion film, full of immaculate gowns and unabashed showmanship. Dana Fox and Tony McNamaras script has Cruella simply be a nickname given to Estellas natural mean streak, which shes done to well bury as a promise to her kindly (and very dead) mother Catherine (Emily Beecham). Its a far less aggressive attempt to rehabilitate a villain than 2014s Maleficent, which poured buckets of tragedy onto Sleeping Beautys relatively simple story of a sorceress peeved that she wasnt invited to a party. Cruella was never good, just in denial.

Director Craig Gillespie is content to pull back and let costume designer Jenny Beavan (who memorably won an Oscar for Mad Max: Fury Road) tell the bulk of the story through her heavenly creations. As Estella grimly scales the fashion industry ladder, she comes up against the ferocious Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson), finding herself both repulsed and enchanted by such a narcissistic genius. Cruella sees a war waged in silk, leather, and lace, with Estellas DIY aesthetics - her outfits seemingly cobbled together from fabric scraps - pitted against the precise silhouettes of the Baronesss traditional, Dior-esque fashion house. What we later see from a fully realised Cruella is a mixture of both, in a clever nod to the way Vivienne Westwood, one of the original fashion punks, adopted and subverted fashion history as she gained mainstream success.

And, since the clothes do most of the work, its everyone elses job simply to keep up. Nicholas Britells jazzy score is paired with an entire jukeboxs worth of vintage hits - whod have ever thought that The Stoogess I Wanna Be Your Dog, thick with sexual overtones, would end up in a Disney film? Gillespie, meanwhile, keeps the film looking slick and elegant, including a nod to Goodfellass famous tracking shot through the Copacabana, as the camera winds through the underbelly of Londons Liberty department store.

Stones performance is commanding enough not to be swallowed up by the wigs and costumes, while she sprinkles in a little wounded pride to lend a sense of genuine pathos to Cruellas madness. But the film belongs equally to her onscreen rival - and Thompson is brilliantly despicable, landing somewhere in between The Devil Wears Pradas Miranda Priestly and Phantom Threads Reynolds Woodcock. The actor keeps Stone on her toes, lest she sweeps the film right from under her. While Joel Frys Jasper, Paul Walter Hausers Horace, and Kirby Howell-Baptistes Anita Darling lend softness and heart to the film, the real pleasure here is watching two formidable comic actors tear into each other while dressed to the nines. Cruella is the most fashionable dogfight of the year.

Title: Cruella review: Emma Stone makes villainy fun and sexy

Think of the delicious new movie Cruella as the Joker of Disney. 

Like the pitch-black Joaquin Phoenix film, it explains the origins and psychology of an infamous villain  this time, Cruella de Vil from 101 Dalmatians. How can we possibly come to understand and like a person whos best known for plotting to skin adorable puppies and sew them into a coat? Who a lyric once described as like a spider waiting for the kill?

Its actually quite easy, because the wondrous Emma Stone plays her.

The two-toned villainess wasnt always Cruella, though. She was born Estella  with all-natural black-and-white hair  to a struggling single mom in Britain. A menace at school, teenaged Estella tells her mother she dreams of going to London to become a fashion designer, and so off they go to start a new life. But on the way, Mom gets killed under strange circumstances at a party (it really earns its PG-13 rating) and the orphaned Estella runs to the city alone. (The movie, in theaters Friday, is also available to stream on Disney+ for $30.)

That horrific introduction gives director Craig Gillespies twisty movie real gravitas, harking back to the heroes of Oliver Twist or Harry Potter. Estellas early trauma and loneliness makes her a smart cookie with an axe to grind. And grind she does.

Arriving in edgy 1970s London, she teams up with pickpockets and eventual henchmen Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) and Jasper (Joel Fry), and through a series of mistakes, winds up working with a frigid fashion designer known as the Baroness (Emma Thompson, dry as kindling). Its at that ritzy house that Estellas sinister alter ego is born.

This film is so sexy and cool and punk rock, you forget all about that Mickey logo and Cinderellas cutesy castle. Cruella starts out as a Banksy of fashion; a mysterious vixen who crashes glamorous society parties and causes a stir with stylish stunts. My favorite: She tumbles out of a garbage truck onto a red carpet and then, when it drives away, the trash becomes the long train of her dress. All of the production design is just as witty and dirty. 

Thank God the entrancing Stone doesnt fall into the same trap Glenn Close did in the 1996 live-action 101 Dalmatians remake in which she was more outlandish and cartoony than the damn cartoon. Stone finds the fabulousness in spewing venomous insults while wearing couture and calling everybody daaaarling. Her transition from nice girl into Cruella de Vil is magic.  

But know this: Cruella is also like Joker in another way  it doesnt perfectly fit into what came before.

Dont waste your time trying to connect the dots  hardy har har  to 101 Dalmatians, because this movie is not so much a prequel as a distant relative. For instance, Cruella was not a fashion designer in the cartoon and Anita Darling wasnt a newspaper writer. 101 Dalmatians did not take place in the 70s because the 70s hadnt happened yet. Also, the Dalmatians in this flick are total A-holes.

Enjoy Cruella as a decadent and exhilarating standalone, daaaarling.

In the original, animated 101 Dalmatians, there was nothing black-and-white about Cruella de Vil. As her name less implied, more flat-out screamed, she was a Disney villain drawn delightfully, deliciously dark. Kudos, then, to director Craig Gillespie for pulling off a live-action prequel that adds a few shades of grey without muddying the character one bit, leaning into Cruellas inherent flamboyance for a slick and stylish clothing caper.

Unlike the Sleeping Beauty villain-reimagining Maleficent, which tied itself in narrative knots attempting to retool the classic fairy tale, Cruella wisely divorces itself from the context of the original film. Where that was released in 1961, based on Dodie Smiths novel from the 50s, this largely takes place in the 1970s  recontextualising Cruellas raucous sartorial stylings as a punk explosion, railing against conformity and scoffing at the safety of the Swinging Sixties. Its a colourful background for a reimagined origin story that takes a young Estella (an impressive Tipper Seifert-Cleveland in an opening act coursing with Matilda-esque mischief) and morphs her into the cackling Cruella via a life of crime, a stint on the shop floor of Liberty, and a job at the most fearsome fashion house in London.

What could have been a mere IP cash-in instead becomes an unexpectedly cinematic crime-and-couture romp.

The result is a tale of two Emmas. Central, of course, is Stone, teasing out Estellas encroaching evil while retaining all the charismatic screen presence thats defined her career so far  and pulling off a decent British accent to boot. Among the theatricality (in one scene she tumbles onto a red carpet from a bin lorry in a giant rubbish-dress) and the two-tone wigs, she finds moments of humanity without diminishing Cruellas delectable extremity. But its Emma Thompson who threatens to steal the film as The Baroness  a fashion boss whose cutthroat nature extends well beyond the catwalk. Whether shes slashing at garments with a straight razor, loudly reading her own rave reviews, or calling people imbeciles with fatal levels of derision, shes a killer creation. Thompson plays it to absolute perfection, running away with every scene shes in.

The pair are so much fun that other players struggle to get a look-in. Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser entertain as Estellas comrades-in-crime, but Mark Strongs valet, John, sinks into the background, Kirby Howell-Baptistes journalist Anita (a nod to the original Dalmatians) appears often while saying little, and John McCreas Bowie-esque, androgynous boutique owner Artie is a disappointingly fleeting presence  hes intriguing enough to deserve his own film.


Though Cruella could easily lose 20 minutes, Gillespie keeps the energy high throughout. The Scorsesean riffs he brought to I, Tonya continue here, from a stacked soundtrack of 60s and 70s greats (The Clash, Blondie, The Stooges), to a stunning extended tracking shot through the halls of Liberty. What could have been a mere IP cash-in instead becomes an unexpectedly cinematic crime-and-couture romp, delivered with the sort of style, snarl and eccentricity that Cruella herself would likely applaud. She makes being bad look very good.

With killer looks, propulsive filmmaking, and stellar turns from Emmas Stone and Thompson, Cruella is a Spring/Summer 21 treat.

There's an excellent Emma in ""Cruella,"" but it may not be the Emma you're thinking of.

Emma Stone is the lead; she plays the title role in a comedy that takes place before most of the events of Disney's classic, animated ""101 Dalmatians."" But the real star is Emma Thompson. She's Cruella De Vil's nemesis, a fashion designer in 1960s London whose nastiness makes Cruella look like a Nobel Peace Prize winner.

The movie, which is in theaters and on Disney Plus, takes awhile getting to either Emma. A 15-minute prologue spends too long filling us in on Cruella's youth, when she's played by kids we're never going to see again and aren't interested in. Things start to click when the adult Cruella, played by Stone, snags an apprenticeship at a design house ruled by the Baroness (Thompson), who announces to no one in particular, ""Gorgeous and vicious  it's my favorite combination.""

There's a little Miranda Priestly in the Baroness and there's more than a little ""The Devil Wears Prada"" in ""Cruella,"" which was cowritten by ""Prada"" screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna. Often, it's hard to say for whom the PG-13 movie was intended. That it comes from Disney and is a brand extension of a children's book/movie makes it appear to be for kids. But the subject matter  two women battle for control of London's fashion market  slides it closer to the ""Prada"" audience of stylish women and the gay men who love them.

Either way, it's the mean authority figure we care about, not the younger woman that we're supposed to love.

This isn't even Thompson's first ""Prada"" knockoff, as she also starred in Mindy Kaling's ""Late Night."" But this character is broader, funnier, more narcissistic and, because she doesn't even bother to hide her monstrousness behind a veneer of etiquette, more strangely lovable.

Thompson usually plays sensible people who don't care about fashion but she looks smashing here in gowns designed by two-time Oscar-winner Jenny Beavan, many of which frame her neck with architectural swoops of fabric. The Baroness is more openly contemptuous than Priestly was and much of her behavior is criminal. Thompson embraces her inner ogre so fully that she makes it great fun to watch the Baroness bark at an underling, ""I need you to stop talking, Roger, so I have a gap to fire you.""

As is often the case, the villain gets all the best lines. Give Stone credit for trying to break out of the nice roles she nearly always plays, but she's not a great fit for Cruella (I'm thinking Kristen Stewart? Florence Pugh?). She also looks great in the Beavan designs, particularly a ballgown with a parachute-like train that must be 30 feet long. But we never get a handle on Stone's Cruella. She is wishy-washy in a way that the character who inspired the line ""Whenever you see her, you start getting ill"" cannot be.

It's not entirely Stone's fault. In a sure sign there were script issues, six writers are credited and none can decide what to do with their main character. Since she's the protagonist, they seem to think she can't be as evil as she was in ""101 Dalmatians."" That forces them either to offer pop psychology explanations for why she broke bad, or to flip her back and forth from good to bad with no explanation (her treatment of minions Jasper and Horace is most puzzling, especially since Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser are excellent in the roles).

Writing this screenplay wouldn't have been an easy assignment since it must make a legendary villain who hates puppies into a likable gal while also setting up a transition into the story told by the original ""101 Dalmatians"" (stick around through the credits for that).

The weird thing is there's a gifted screenwriter on board who seems ideal for pulling all those things together: Thompson, who won an Oscar for adapting Jane Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility."" That screenplay was gorgeous and vicious, as well as romantic and sweet  my favorite combination.

With her shock of black-and-white hair and crimson color scheme, Cruella de Vil is one of Disneys most durable villains. She made for a terrifying antagonist in the delightful 1961 animated film One Hundred and One Dalmatians, and gave Glenn Close some delectable scenery to chew in 101 Dalmatians, an otherwise forgettable 1996 live-action version. Now, Emma Stone tries her hand at playing a would-be puppy killer in Cruella, an origin story that achieves the dubious feat of being tedious, transgressive, chaotic and inert at the same time.

It should surprise no one that in Cruella, it comes to light that Cruellas mean-spiritedness and Dalmatian-hating tendencies have their roots in a primal loss  here, the result of a Disney-esque momicide. As an orphan running amok on London streets in the early 1960s, young Cruella is still known by her birth name, Estella, and harbors dreams of becoming a fashion designer while pulling petty heists with the good humored neer-do-wells Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) and Jasper (Joel Fry). When a chance encounter results in Estella becoming an apprentice to a revered designer named the Baroness (Emma Thompson), she finally gets a chance to let her gifts emerge; she also learns that creative genius and bad behavior are joined at the perfectly sheathed hip.

Driven by an over-insistent soundtrack that ranges from the Beatles, Stones and Supertramp to Nina Simone and Blondie, and drawing inspiration from English fashion trends spanning Carnaby Street boho chic to the trashed-out aesthetic of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, Cruella isnt a movie as much as its a mood board come aggressively to life. This makes for some admittedly spectacular set pieces, especially when they revolve around Jenny Beavans wildly imaginative costumes and Tom Daviess divine eyewear. Channeling the haughty couture of The Devil Wears Prada and Phantom Thread  with a dash of Scott Rudin thrown in for toxic measure  Thompson plays the Baroness with sang-froid bordering on psychopathology: In one scene she slashes Estellas hand and instead of apologizing, simply directs her fabric department to match that precise shade of red.

As witheringly funny as Thompson is in Cruella, finding humor in abuse of power feels queasily out of step with the current moment (op. cit., Rudin). Things get even trickier when it comes to the title character, who despite Stones best efforts never becomes more interesting than just a nasty-natured person awash in self-pity and revenge. Taking a page from Joker here and Suicide Squad there, director Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) and his team of screenwriters want to ground their antiheroines antisocial rage and violence in psychological loss. But, surrounded by characters who are just as unpleasant as she is, Stones Cruella simply becomes one more person behaving badly in a story overstuffed with incident for its own sake.

Stone actually delivers an accomplished performance in Cruella, credibly assuming an arch English accent along with dramatic makeup and myriad black-and-white wigs. Fry and Hauser  the latter doing his best Ray Winstone impression  bring Dickensian sweetness to their roles. (Mark Strong, unfortunately, is wasted as the Baronesss stone-faced aide-de-camp.)

But whatever good intentions were brought to bear in Cruella are lost in an overlong, awkwardly shaped mash-up of coming-of-age drama, caper flick, action adventure and fashion world sendup. The constant barrage of needle drops from classic rock songs results in feeling bludgeoned into submission by a movie constantly trying to prove its hip bona fides. The climactic reveal of Cruellas most notorious design (involving those Dalmatians and a showstopping coat) is first staged as an act of punk-rock subversion and ultimately as a brand-saving, Who me? hoax.

Such is the challenge of Cruella: making a charmless figure at least sympathetic enough to care about watching, while softening her most inhumane actions only as much as the original character will bear. Its not an easy needle to thread, especially in an atelier as miserably misanthropic as this one.

Title: Emma Thompson wipes Emma Stone off the screen in misbegotten Cruella

Everything thats good about Cruella cant obscure the fact that it was a very bad idea. The movie makes gestures toward style. It has first-rate costume design. The soundtrack contains a series of well-loved but mostly irrelevant pop songs from the 1960s and 70s. But we still end up with a movie that should never have been made.

The world was not clamoring for an origin story about the 101 Dalmatians villain, Cruella de Vil, and the movie doesnt justify making one.

An origin story is a hard sell to begin with, because we already know how the person ends up, but it can work well if the central character is complicated and fascinating. But because Cruella is a one-dimensional figure, the best this latest Disney live-action film can offer is the hardly gripping spectacle of how a three-dimensional person lost two dimensions and turned into a combination monster/joke. Cruella cant even manage that. Instead, it gives us Emma Stone struggling to make emotional sense of a vacuum.

Over and over, the movie insists that we pity poor Cruella, just as Stone begs us to feel sorry for her, and we do  that is, we end up pitying poor Emma Stone, which was not the intention.

The story here is that young Estella, through a combination of misfortunes, grows up a street urchin, supporting herself through crime (we learn how she earns the nickname Cruella early on). By the time shes an adult, Estella wants to become a fashion designer. She ends up getting a job working for a design house headed by a narcissist known as the Baroness, played by Emma Thompson. Thompsons Baroness is the best thing  and only good thing  in the movie. The only downside is that every time the two Emmas have a scene together, in which they must be drippingly arch and very British, Older Emma wipes Younger Emma right off the screen.

Yet heres something interesting: Five people wrote the screenplay and almost came up with a decent story about two ambitious, amoral women heading for an inevitable collision. What tripped the writers up was the Cruella angle. It allowed them to be lazy, to ignore loose ends by thinking, Well, its based on a cartoon. With a similar story about an otherwise named character, they would not have been able to rely on cuteness and flash, and they could not have plot holes the size of a movie screen.

The movie is framed as Cruellas autobiography, which Stone narrates in voice-over, but the writing is so careless that they actually ended up with these two sentences within 30 seconds of each other: The good thing about evil people is that you can always trust them to do something, well, evil; and Theres something about poetic justice thats just so  poetic. Thats two sentences in the same minute with an identical construction. It wasnt even clever the first time.

Cruella was directed by Craig Gillespie, an Australian director who is now in the third phase of a successful Hollywood career. In the promising phase, he made 2007s Lars and the Real Girl. In the fulfillment phase, he made the brilliant I, Tonya, one of the best films of 2017. Now Gillespie is in the get-rich phase, in which a director employs all his gifts to give junk cinema the gloss of quality, under the pretense that doing so doesnt really represent a compromise.

That phase is also known as the Dark Side. Lets hope he comes back.

Title: Cruella Puts a High-Energy, Artificial Spotlight on a Classic Disney Villain

     Keywords:  Craig Gillespie, Cruella DeVille, 101 Dalmatians, 1961, Glenn Close, 1996, Emma Stone, Disney, Gregory Maguire, Wizard of Oz, Broadway, Baroness von Hellman, Emma Thompson, British, Tipper Seifert-Cleveland, Florisa Kamara, Britain, Easter, the 70s, London, the intervening years, Kirby Howell-Baptiste, Paul Walter Hauser, Joel Fry, Estella, Todd Phillips, Cathy Yan, Margot Robbie 

Craig Gillespies Cruella explores the backstory of Cruella DeVille, the would-be dalmatian poacher who debuted in animated form in 1961s 101 Dalmatians and was played by Glenn Close in its 1996 live-action remake. The punningly named fashion designer goes from colorful arch villain to colorfully arch antihero in Gillespies follow-up to I, Tonya, with Emma Stone stepping into the eponymous role. Its a film that exists seemingly less because anybody has been asking for such a take on the character and more because Cruella is another intellectual property that can easily be poured into the evil-witch-turned-misunderstood-protagonist mold recently cast by Disneys Maleficent movies.

But Cruellas more obvious precedent is Wicked. Like Gregory Maguires novelistic riff on Wizard of Oz and its Broadway adaptation, Gillespies film takes a monstrous character best known for her distaste for pets and other signs of bourgeois pleasantness and turns her into an animal lover shaped by a conflict with her own inhuman antagonist. The result is that Cruella, an evil-hag stereotype that beckoned camp appropriation, becomes just another nice girlthat is, relative to her nemesis, Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson), the new ur-maven of fashion cruelty in this movie universe. You may wonder how deep this rabbit hole could gowhether in 20 years well get a prequel about the Baronesss own formative bte noire. Will it turn out to be haughty, maniacal villainesses all the way down?

Cruellas first act establishes the backstorys backstory: An older Cruellas voiceover accompanies the audience through a whiz-bang overview of her troubled childhood, in which her aggressive defiance of bullies both individual and institutional gets her expelled from a British private school. Its at the school where the obstreperous young Cruella, played in these scenes by Tipper Seifert-Cleveland, befriends Anita Darling (Florisa Kamara), who, implicitly because the setting is 60s Britain and shes one of the few black students at the small-town school, is able to sympathize with the outcast Cruella. To the extent that Anitas presence in the film turns out to be more than an Easter egg for those who recognize her name as belonging to the future co-owner of a certain 101 pups, its simply so the character can function to align Cruellas ostracization with the plight of the marginalized.

After the magic of montage has skipped us forward a decade (much of the film plays out as a montage of scenes set to a selection of recognizable hits, mostly from the 70s), we find Cruella living by her wits as a scrappy young orphan in London. In the intervening years shes found two sidekicks to functionally replace Anita (now played by Kirby Howell-Baptiste), fellow orphans-slash-con-artists Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) and Jasper (Joel Fry). Now going exclusively by her birth name, Estella, and covering her naturally chiaroscuro coif with an auburn wig that looks an awful lot like the way Emma Stone usually wears her hair, the dognapper-in-the-making uses grift and pluck to get herself a position designing clothes at the Baronesss firm. There, a discovery about a secret in the aristocratic designers past inspires Estella to assume a dual identity, letting her alter-ego take over in a series of fashion-cum-vandalism stunts that chip away at the Baronesss fashion empire and her self-assurance.

Cruella is nothing if not a film of our present moment, given how the heros flirtation with anarchy is emphasized by the flagrantly stylized depiction of her exploits. If the 70s setting and Cruellas initially grimy digs and all-consuming obsession with the Baroness recall Todd Phillipss Joker, Stones flip, diaristic voiceover (not to mention her chalk-white visage) brings to mind Cathy Yans Birds of Prey. Like Margot Robbie in the latter film, Stone relishes her role, playing Cruella as if she were headlining a burlesque show, and affecting a London-ish accent thats as artificial as a polyester boa. We hadnt stahhted yet, dahhling, she facetiously drawls during an unlikely hand-to-hand confrontation with the Baronesss goon squad.

Stones performance can be fun to watch, but even her depiction of Cruellas increasing psychosis and imperiousness toward Horace and Jasper isnt enough to remove the impression that Disney is de-toothing a character whose originating motivation was the desire to murder and skin somebody elses pets. So eager to please us with sumptuous costumes and rhythmic montage, and to refresh its trademarked character by applying the same melodramatic narrative logic as countless recent properties, Cruellas outward liveliness cant mask the inner inertia it has as just another lifeless product assembled in a factory.

170,WF_Doc10__Home-Alone_-Reboot,"If at first it sucks, why reboot it?

Ellie Kemper is set to star in a reboot of 'Home Alone', the remake we never knew we seriously do not want. At all.

Home Alone sucks. There, I said it. You may disagree with me, but then you would be wrong.

Anything responsible for bringing Macaulay Culkin to the world really should be spanked until it's raw, but add to that a tale of weirdly glossed over negligent parents, two of the dumbest robbers ever born and gross immense privilege, and it's all a Christmas vomit-fest I can do without.

But Disney+ disagrees with me - presumably because it's far more lucrative to remake a crowd favourite than it is to come up with a fresh idea - so Home Alone is the latest in a long string of movies that should have been forgotten by now to be remade.

The best thing I can say about this is that at least Macaulay Culkin can't return to play precocious Kevin McCallister, the kid who has been left behind as his parents head off on holidays.

Just in case you're the only person left in the world to have dodged the 1990 Christmas classic, Home Alone tells the cheerful tale of Kevin, who thinks all his Christmases have come at once when his family head off on holidays, accidentally leaving him in their palatial home - where he fends off a pair of inept burglars, played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.

Of course, by the end, Kevin has saved the day and learned that his family is really all he wants for Christmas. Oh - and his parents notice they've left him at home and come back. Heartwarming, as long as nobody calls social services.

Now, there's a new version on its way, and although there is some detail emerging that may redeem the idea, there is little that can be done about a sucky storyline.

The delightful Ellie Kemper (The Office, Bridesmaids, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt) is set to star in the remake, alongside Rob Delaney (Catastrophe, Deadpool 2), and Archie Yates, who had a breakout role in Jojo Rabbit this year.

But let's not assume the trio will play Kevin and his parents. Apparently there is to be a significant rewrite of the script, and a report in Variety suggests they will all play new characters.

So it will be a new story, with new characters, being peddled as an old movie.

Okay, cool.

Which proves that remaking Home Alone is probably the most horrible idea to have ever been hatched in Hollywood. And they made Snakes on a Plane.

All of this suggests that big money will be injected into the project, Macaulay Culkin will probably be given a cameo, and billions of nostalgic patsies will flock to screenings all over the world.

It will probably become the highest grossing movie of all time.

What would I know?
",WF_Doc10__Home-Alone_-Reboot,Will Fleurant,Comedy,Negative,Home Alone
171,WF_Doc1_Home-Alone-(Review),"The king of 80s teen angst, John Hughes will be forever be venerated by Gen-Xers as the writer/director of our Holy Flick: Ferris Buellers Day Off. But his favorite movie with the rest of the world is probably Home Alone, which Hughes wrote. One indication, admittedly drawn from an extremely tiny sampling of moviewatchers: To this day, ten years after the release of the biggest-grossing film of 1990, my mother  who tends to refer to actors as the guy from that TV show or the one who was married to that other one in that movie  calls Macaulay Culkin, adoringly, Home Alone.

My mom is not alone. By pretty much universal popular acclaim, Home Alone has established itself as a modern classic. And it deserves that status. Yes, as a drama, its obvious and sentimental. As a comedy, its silly and cartoonish, like watching an 8-year-old Road Runner fend off two Wily Coyotes. But hey, those old toons were pretty darn entertaining.

Ah, the lives of people who live in John Hughes movies  and those directed by Chris Columbus (Stepmom), as Home Alone is. Living the upper-middle-class dream, the McCallisters ramble through a suburban Chicago home thats closer to being a mansion than a tract house: their kitchen alone, I swear, has more square footage than my four-room apartment. And for Christmas this year, the lucky McCallisters are going to Paris: two parents and all five (or is it six?) kids, along with a handful of cousins and a matching aunt-and-uncle set. The adults will be flying in first class, no less. The thought of having this kind of money is beyond me. Just the cost of heating that house would kill me.

But theyre not perfect, so its okay to hate them. Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), the youngest kid in the bunch, is ignored to the point that hes expected to pack his own suitcase, which I imagine would result in a bag full of comic books and one sneaker. Hes picked on by everyone, and when his uncle calls him a little jerk (for the crime of spilling a glass of milk), his mother (Catherine OHara: The Nightmare Before Christmas) does not come to her childs defense with a Hey, dont call my son a jerk. Heck, she doesnt even throw the uncle a dirty look. Instead, she sends Kevin to bed, way up in the attic guest room, all alone. Families suck, Kevin observes, and its hard not to agree with the little guy.

So imagine his delight when he awakens the next morning to find himself all alone in the humongous house. Unbeknownst to him, the entire gang overslept, and in the mad rush to get to the airport, Kevin was inadvertently left behind  and its not until the plane is airborne that Moms nagging feeling that theyve forgotten something pays off. But Kevin thinks his wish that they would all just disappear has been granted, and he couldnt be happier.

The young Culkin is a little self-conscious on camera, but he has definite charm, and carries the movie by himself with no problem  this is, perhaps, one of the most memorable child starring roles in movie history. His glee at being home alone is tempered by fear, naturally, especially of the scary furnace in the basement, and Culkin balances these opposing emotions well. And as a grownup whos had to try to keep herself from laughing at the precocious antics of a child, so as not to encourage too much similar behavior, I like being able to laugh safely at a skinny little kid, clad only in a towel, lip-synching in a mirror to a jazzy version of White Christmas  or later, mouthing along with the dialogue of a hard-boiled noir flick on the VCR.

This kind of too-adult behavior rankles if it goes on too long, though, and here its tempered by the fact that Kevin is a pretty realistic kid. Even when the movie turns outrageously slapsticky with the arrival of the stupid and petty  and funny  burglars Harry (Joe Pesci: Lethal Weapon 4) and Marv (Daniel Stern: Very Bad Things), Kevins reaction, as he springs to the defense of his home, is believable if highly exaggerated. Kids can be very protective of their little worlds, and Kevin is determined to keep his stuff safe.

What is slightly improbable, however, is that Kevin would get the mess he and the burglars make in the house cleaned up in time for the inevitable return of Mom and Co.. But this is just a fantasy, after all.
",WF_Doc1_Home-Alone-(Review),Will Fleurant,Comedy,Positive,Home Alone
172,WF_Doc2_Heartwarming-Holiday-Family,"'Home Alone' has succeeded in establishing itself as a Christmas tradition, spawning off three sequels (including a made-for-television flop), and a whole franchise in and of it.

Macaulay Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, the average American child. He has an attitude almost expected of a Chris Columbus film from the eighties. He lives with a large family, which, right now, being around Christmas time, is about quadrupled, flooded by relatives' children, all of whom pick on poor, poor Kevin (sympathy long lost later into the film).

One day Kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true: his parents (John Heard and Catherine O'Hara) have disappeared. Enthralled by this, he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before, including eating ice cream in the morning, watching violent gangster films, jumping on the bed, wrecking his brother's room, and having some fun with a BB gun. Unfortunately for Kevin, his parents have not just disappeared - they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!

Trouble really starts when two pesky burglars, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared, arming the house with an array of booby-traps that would impress top spies in the American government.

John Hughes, writer/director/producer of my favorite comedy, 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' wrote this film, and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion, belly laughs and a warm-hearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films, in my experience, are usually very good, mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude, kid jokes, like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo,' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts, and nothing is different here. Also, he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago; a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' (I would not be surprised if it is the same home).

As for the acting.

Macaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck,' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here, he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately, with great performances by John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Pesci and Stern, his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.

John Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father, Peter (Heard), is very calm and laidback. His mother, Kate (O'Hara) is extremely nervous almost all the time, fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and, like all mothers, her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.

And then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor, pain and aggravation to the film.

Pesci's character Harry is very strict, easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv, the stereotypical 'tall, stupid one,' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most, mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him. Stern brings a great trait to the character of Marv, and I am very pleased he got the part. It's a hard choice to decide which baddie is better, so I just say I like them both the same.

All in all, 'Home Alone' is probably the best Christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years. It seamlessly blends humor, pain, emotion, human instinct and some great booby-traps all into one little bundle. This film has stood the test of time greatly.

173,WF_Doc3_Movie-Review-Home,"A family Christmas comedy, Home Alone strikes all the right tones in a tale of a kid forgotten behind at the most magical time of year.

In a Chicago suburb, the McCallister family prepares for a Christmas vacation trip to Paris. Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) is the smart but exasperating eight year old youngest son, generally overlooked by his parents Kate and Peter (Catherine O'Hara and John Heard) and tormented by his siblings. With the family chaotically extended by the presence of Kevin's ornery uncle and his brood, no one notices burglar Harry Lyme (Joe Pesci) disguised as a police officer scoping the soon-to-be-empty house.

In the travel day rush the family bundles off to the airport and then onto the plane with Kevin forgotten home alone. He has to fend for himself, keeping a wary eye on spooky neighbour Marly (Roberts Blossom), and gradually realizes Harry and his partner Marv (Daniel Stern) are intent on burglarizing the house. On the plane Kate awakens to her blunder, and once in Paris immediately starts the long trip back. But unscheduled travel arrangements during the Holidays will prove a challenge.

Writer and producer John Hughes turns his attention away from teenagers and towards the younger kids. Maintaining his sharp wit and ear to the ground, Hughes conjures up a Christmas classic in a story where be-careful-what-you-wish-for applies to both the kids and adults.

In the lead up to the Paris trip Kevin makes a nuisance of himself by just being a kid, but his unintended mess results in hot emotions and sharp words. Kate banishes him to the attic, out of sight and out of mind, and Kevin wishes his whole family would just disappear already. Both their wishes come true, as the next morning the family is free of Kevin's presence and he awakens to an empty house, sure he was responsible for everyone's disappearance.

With director Chris Columbus capably translating Hughes' vision to the screen, what follows is a journey of redemption for Kate, and she has to overcome every conceivable travel nightmare to make it back to her son as soon as possible. Her trip will include a travel leg in a U-Haul van with John Candy's legendary (sort of) polka band, Hughes elegantly tying Home Alone with 1987's Planes, Trains And Automobiles.

Meantime Kevin is growing up in a hurry, confronting fears including the boiler in the basement and the mysterious neighbour-with-the-shovel. But worse is to come, the bumbling burglar duo of Harry and Marv absolutely intent on hitting the prized McCallister house (Hughes never quite explains how this family came to live in a luxurious mansion). Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are admirably dedicated to the doofus antagonists roles, and add immeasurably to the film's madcap physical humour.

Home Alone reaches a quite hilarious climax with Kevin concocting a defence of the house to thwart and humiliate the robbers at every turn, in the hope help will arrive in a true Christmas miracle. Here Hughes even manages a nod to the intervention by the misunderstood next-door presence from To Kill A Mockingbird territory.

With Columbus cajoling a superlative and ridiculously appealing performance out of young Macaulay Culkin, Home Alone ticks along in perfect harmony with the spirit of personal growth through family appreciation, laughing all the way.
",WF_Doc3_Movie-Review-Home,Will Fleurant,Comedy,Positive,Home Alone
174,WF_Doc4_Home-Alone-Film,"Home Alone is a brilliant film directed by John Hughes, which explains the hilarious story of a house robbery attempt through the eyes eight year old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin). The director starts the story in Kevins house where his family is getting ready to leave for France the next day. While they are preparing their last dinner at their house before they leave for France, Kevin gets into a fight with his brother and is forced to sleep on the third floor. His parents forget to bring him on the family trip due to being rushed from a power outage overnight and being isolated since he is on the third floor. This leaves Kevin alone with no power in his house for days. During his time alone he realizes that a pair of thieves are planning to rob his house, but he creates the ultimate plan to take them down and send them to jail.

As the film progresses, the audience sees Kevin start off as selfish stubborn kid, like in the beginning when he claims that when he is older his is going to live alone. His unwillingness to accept his family soon gets changed later in the film when he realizes that he needs their love and protection when he is confronted with the fearful situation of his house getting robbed. During the the time his family is gone he claims that he will never be a pain in the butt again if his parents came back for him. Because of his maturity and change of character, Kevin portrays a dynamic character which is clearly evident to the audience because even though the movie is shot from a third person view, the audience sees through Kevins eyes and feels his emotions.

Not only was the plot entertaining, the film was also very well put together. Everything in the story was well explained, which makes it enjoyable for anyone to watch. An example of this would be that the reason why Kevin couldn't call his parents to tell them that he was okay while they were gone was because the power lines were destroyed which also explain why his family was almost late to their flight which caused them to leave Kevin home. Because the whole plot was thoroughly thought out, the movie performs seamlessly. The movie also used camera angles to quietly set a tone in the movie. When the camera was looking towards Kevin, the camera was pointed downwards so the audience would view Kevin as just a child, but when the camera was pointed to adults, the camera was pointed upwards to make Kevin seem smaller. Not only was the movie edited well, the actors were superb. Each character seemed believable to the audience, for example, Buzz McCallister(Devin Ratray), Kevins older brother, plays the stereotypic mean older brother. During the time Kevin and Buzz talk to each other, it is clear that there is tension, and because the actors performed at a high level it was very believable and truly brought life to the film.

During this movie, Kevin McCallister goes through a series of fearful external events including being left home alone for days and having to confront two thiefs. These fears actually push Kevin forward as he turns from a small helpless boy who has never packed a suitcase before to a mature eight year old who takes care of his house when he is home alone. This makes the audience smile in the end after going through the stress because of the series of fears Kevin must go through to get stronger. Because of its interesting plot, believable characters, and a hilarious script, I would definitely recommend this family friendly film to anyone searching for a comedic film.",WF_Doc4_Home-Alone-Film,Will Fleurant,Comedy,Positive,Home Alone

An unforgettable performance by our pint sized lead (who acts as if hes triple his age at times) lends itself to a playful, endearing, and outright fun festive feature.

On the way he tells his mother Kate (Catherine OHara) that he wishes his family would disappear. Whats said in anger, especially to a parent, hardly ever carries some weight, and when he wakes the next day to an empty house he cant believe its come true.

There are a lot of terrific sequences where Kevin exercises his freedom as any eight-year-old would do: eating and jumping on the bed, watching bad movies, even sledding down the staircase. These moments entice us, making us yearn for such pure instances of elation.

One moment Kevin can seem wise beyond his years and in the next frame he can be the child that he is, both in joy and sorrow. He also manages to thwart the wet bandits (though dont let Harry hear me saying that) who intend to rob the wealthy block the McCallisters live on.

Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern) and Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) are almost fooled by Kevin when he tries to make them think the house is full of people. When the initial jig is up, their obsession for this home only increases, which demands that Kevin prepare.

The kid saving the day trope was basically born here, and if it wasnt  it was improved. The resilient Kevin uses a variety of boobie traps, including some pretty intense ones that include fire, nails and bowling balls. Things that should probably kill them, but we wont linger there.

John Williams score is among a list of excellent decisions in Home Alone, and its one that was crafted with expert precision. Its somehow cheery and mischievous at the same time, always alluding to potential antics around every corner.

Its never fully acknowledged the degree of parental neglect, perhaps because mistakes make us human (though the second film is a little it more really?), but another area thats portrayed and yet hardly really felt, is the actual danger Kevin is in. These two might be complete idiots and he might be the master of homemade home security, but they could have really hurt him.

Of course they dont, and despite being villains, Pesci and Stern are remarkably watchable. Yes, they are putz (and I rarely use this word but it seems meant for them) and criminals who are quite pathetic at their intended profession. But, damn if we dont like seeing them topple down the stairs (even if it is extreme). The two stars also sell it very well, ensuring laughs.

Its a movie that probably wouldnt be made today, and its unique in a variety of ways, including Kevins fourth wall breaking acknowledgments to the audience.

The house, which is nearly a character in and of itself, is where a majority of the film takes place and the production is so good it feels lived in. Theres never a moment where you forget its Christmas either, through appropriate color schemes and frequent cues, the Holiday is very much alive.

Some of the movie careens, such as how Old Man Marley (Robert Blussoms)  even if it is sweet  helps to convey the lessons learned aspect of the narrative. The supporting cast members including the feisty Kate and his even keeled father (John Heard) do their diligence.

Part of the film is the family rushing back to Kevin after realizing whats happened. The determined Kate decides to take an early flight, but its not direct, so she ends up riding with a polka band.

A cameo by John Candy, while not really a requirement of the plot, (they all arrive at the same time anyway) brings some light to an otherwise stressful situation. And, in my book, Candy is always a necessary addition.

CONCLUSION: HOME ALONE

The charisma of Macaulay Culkin matched with the intelligent script by John Hughes makes this the definitive holiday story that it is, appealing to all ages. Culkin is adorable, and we laugh alongside his signature moments, but hes also just the right amount of emotion when its needed.

While you may have to suspend your disbelief a bit, Home Alone is feel good cinema at its finest.",WF_Doc5_Home-Alone-Still,Will Fleurant,Comedy,Positive,Home Alone
176,WF_Doc6_Home-Alone,"""Home Alone"" is a splendid movie title because it evokes all sorts of scary nostalgia. Being left home alone, when you were a kid, meant hearing strange noises and being afraid to look in the basement - but it also meant doing all the things that grownups would tell you to stop doing, if they were there. Things like staying up to watch Johnny Carson, eating all the ice cream, and sleeping in your parents' bed.

""Home Alone"" is about an 8-year-old hero who does all of those things, but unfortunately he also single-handedly stymies two house burglars by booby-trapping the house. And they're the kinds of traps that any 8-year-old could devise, if he had a budget of tens of thousands of dollars and the assistance of a crew of movie special effects people.

The movie's screenplay is by John Hughes, who sometimes shows a genius for remembering what it was like to be young. His best movies, such as ""Sixteen Candles,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles,"" find a way to be funny while still staying somewhere within the boundaries of remote plausibility. This time, he strays so far from his premise that the movie suffers.

If ""Home Alone"" had limited itself to the things that might possibly happen to a forgotten 8-year-old, I think I would have liked it more. What I didn't enjoy was the subplot involving the burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), who are immediately spotted by little Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), and made the targets of his cleverness.

The movie opens in the Chicago suburbs with a houseful of people on the eve of a big family Christmas vacation in Paris. There are relatives and kids everywhere, and when the family oversleeps and has to race to the airport, Kevin is somehow overlooked in the shuffle. When he wakes up later that morning, the house is empty. So he makes the best of it.

A real kid would probably be more frightened than this movie character, and would probably cry. He might also try calling someone, or asking a neighbor for help. But in the contrived world of this movie, the only neighbor is an old coot who is rumored to be the Snow Shovel Murderer, and the phone doesn't work. When Kevin's parents discover they've forgotten him, they find it impossible to get anyone to follow through on their panicked calls - if anyone did so, the movie would be over.

The plot is so implausible that it makes it hard for us to really care about the plight of the kid. What works in the other direction, however, and almost carries the day, is the gifted performance by young Macaulay Culkin, as Kevin. Culkin is the little boy who co-starred with John Candy in ""Uncle Buck,"" and here he has to carry almost the whole movie. He has lots of challenging acting scenes, and he's up to them. I'm sure he got lots of help from director Chris Columbus, but he's got the stuff to begin with. He's such a confident and gifted little actor that I'd like to see him in a story I could care more about.

""Home Alone"" isn't that story. When the burglars invade Kevin's home, they find themselves running a gamut of booby traps so elaborate they could have been concocted by Rube Goldberg - or by the berserk father in ""Last House on the Left."" Because all plausibility is gone, we sit back, detached, to watch stunt men and special effects guys take over a movie that promised to be the kind of story audiences could identify with.",WF_Doc6_Home-Alone,Will Fleurant,Comedy,Negative,Home Alone
177,WF_Doc7__Home-Alone_-Is,"'Home Alone' is actually the worst Christmas film of all time

Don't believe the hype. Home Alone is actually the worst Christmas film of all time.

Let me explain.

Home Alone, the iconic 1990 comedy that launched the career of Macaulay Culkin, is best known for its unconventional take on the family Christmas genre.

To jog your memory, Home Alone follows the story of industrious eight-year-old Kevin McCallister, who is accidentally left at home in Chicago when his family flies to France for Christmas. Everything's swell until a pair of cat burglars, known as The Wet Bandits, show up to rob the place, leaving poor Kevin to defend his family's home all alone.

I've seen Home Alone a million times and spent many Christmas Eve nights quoting every line with my older brother. But now, as an adult, I realise that if you really look closely, Home Alone might have more in common with The Shining than Miracle on 34th Street.

I probably could come up with 101 reasons to back this up, but in the interest of time, and fear that a real-life Kevin McCallister might find out where I live and duct tape me to my ceiling or something, here are the top seven reasons why Home Alone is pretty messed up.

7. Kevin McCallister  ""wished"" his family away

Maybe this should be aimed at Home Alone's writer and director, the venerable John Hughes, but Kevin spends a chunk of the film thinking he literally wished his family into oblivion.

Can you imagine the mental gymnastics he went through, as an eight-year-old kid, thinking he's never going to see his family again and that it's totally his fault?

In his defense, Hughes perfectly plays up Kevin's full evolution, from terror to ecstasy to determination, but c'mon.

That's dark as hell.

6.  Kevin is kind of a jerk

""This house is so full of people it makes me sick. When I grow up and get married, I'm living alone,"" Kevin shouted at no one, before ""wishing"" his family away for good.

Sure, his siblings ignore him and his mom made him sleep with cousin Fuller (played by Macaulay's real-life brother Kieran), who loves soda as much as he does wetting the bed. And, yeah, Kevin's Uncle Frank won't let him watch gangster movies, and there's never any of his beloved cheese pizza left for him (we'll come back to this in a bit).

But this kid has reached a level of ""I can't even"" usually reserved for when the good guy crosses over to the dark side.

Like, relax, bro.

5. Cheese pizza isn't all the great

Don't at me.

4. Who leaves a kid behind before an international vacation?

One time, when I was about six, my mum forgot me in the cereal aisle at the market. I still don't think she's over it.

Kevin's mom (played by the lovely Catherine O'Hara) eventually figured it out, in perhaps film's most iconic scene, but this was after the plane had taken off for France.

Also, as sassy as Kevin is, I find it hard to believe that no one noticed he hadn't yet complained about getting stuck with a middle seat.

3. The (fake) myth around Old Man Marley

Kevin's big brother Buzz tells him a horrifying story about their elderly neighbour, Old Man Marley (Roberts Blossom). According to Buzz, Marley killed his entire family after a bitter dispute and buried them beneath the sidewalk in front of his home. Every night, during winter, he shovels the sidewalk of snow and covers it with salt, so the bodies turn into mummies.

Also known as Nightmare City.

But, as you may remember, the real deal is that Mr. Marley is just a sweet man who desperately wants to spend Christmas with his estranged son and granddaughter, and gets some unlikely help from Kevin to make it happen.

2. There's an eight-year-old brandishing a weapon

Upon re-watching Home Alone recently, I couldn't help but wonder, WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? 

Once Kevin realises his family is ""gone"", one of the first things he does is steal Buzz's pellet gun. Sure it's all fun and games, shooting down army figurines into the laundry shoot, until 

1. Kevin commits murder, like, a bajillion times

Remember The Wet Bandits? Afters days of casing Kevin's neighbourhood, they finally decide Christmas Eve is the night they hit the McCallister's. But of course, Kevin is ready for them.

In a string of intricate booby traps that made me shriek in delight as a kid, Kevin unleashes fury on crooks Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Sterns): He shoots Harry in the crotch and Marv in the face with the pellet gun. He brands Marv with a hot iron and makes him step on a spiky nail with his bare foot.

KEVIN BURNS HARRY'S SCALP WITH A BLOWTORCH, GUYS.

And that's just the big moments. Basically, these guys must have nine lives, because Kevin McCallister was straight up trying to kill them.

The worst part is, Kevin enjoyed it so much he saved some pain for the sequel. (Fun fact: Culkin reportedly earned a cool $4.5 million for Home Alone 2.)

So, maybe it's time we strip The Grinch of the title, because Kevin McCallister is definitely a Christmas savage.

Do me a favour and revisit Home Alone, and tell me you can't watch it the same way again.

Happy Christmas!",WF_Doc7__Home-Alone_-Is,Will Fleurant,Comedy,Negative,Home Alone
178,WF_Doc8_1990-_Home-Alone_,"After 17 films, there is now a John Hughes world as instantly recognizable as the Monument Valley of John Ford or the studio-built Paris of Ernst Lubitsch, except that Hughesland is a little less exotic.

It consists of long, tree-lined streets made up of sturdy north suburban homes, preferably of the two-story Colonial style. In them live families that consist of well-meaning though slightly distracted dads, warmly protective moms, thuggish older brothers, tensely postpubescent sisters and, at the bottom of the pecking order, precocious but insecure little boys.

For all its apparent stability and timelessness, Hughesland is actually a highly vulnerable environment, constantly threatened by emotional conflict within (from the resentments that naturally build up in families) and class conflict without (from hostile representatives of the urban proletariat, up from the great city that lies to the south).

All of these elements are present in the generally engaging ""Home Alone,"" which was written and produced by Hughes and directed, in a seamless imitation of Hughes' style, by Chris Columbus.

This time, the house belongs to the McCallisters-a Winnetka family desperately engaged in last-minute preparations for a Christmas vacation in Paris. Somehow, in the chaos produced by visiting in-laws, mountains of half- packed luggage and an electrical outage, the well-meaning dad (John Heard) and warmly protective mom (Catherine O`Hara) manage to make their plane with only one small detail neglected-their youngest son, precocious but insecure Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), has been forgotten at home, all alone.

It's a typically clever Hughes premise, and for much of the movie, director Columbus develops it with wit and warmth. While Mom tries to make her way back from Paris (recapitulating much of Hughes' ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles,"" including a guest appearance by John Candy), little Kevin learns to make his way on his own. At first, he indulges in a bit of id-driven revolt (eating junk food, watching violent videocassettes, trashing his older brother`s toys), but soon settles into a responsible routine, going grocery shopping and even doing the laundry. (The boy, who is Bonnie Bedelia`s nephew in real life, is sweet-faced and refreshingly unaffected.)

Hughes creates characters that are immediately recognizable and immediately likable, though there always comes a point in his films when he breaks faith with them-when he goes behind their backs to impose a heavy moral lesson or a blunt ideological point. He doesn't seem to trust his characters to carry his film-a former advertising man, he`s always got something to sell. It happens in ""Home Alone"" with the appearance of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, as two bumbling burglars clearly up from Chicago, who have been casing out the McCallisters' apparently empty home. All of Hughes' middle-class paranoia comes out in these figures, who represent an imagined urban, ethnic, anti-family threat to the white-bread purity of the suburban paradise.

In the appealing ""Uncle Buck,"" Hughes worked to co-opt that fear, using the John Candy character as a way of incorporating urban energy and unpredictability into the suburbs, of fighting off the deadly suburban threat of boredom.

But in ""Home Alone,"" fear predominates (as it did, to an almost racist degree, in Columbus' earlier ""Adventures in Babysitting""). The two burglars must be fought off with a violence and sadistic glee far beyond the requirements of the plot, as little Kevin sets a variety of traps that involve blowtorches, plummeting weights and nails driven through bare feet. The attitude is ugly, and so is the humor.

With its quotes from ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""Home Alone"" seems to be nominating itself as a Christmas classic, and although it's much too self-conscious in its sentimentality (Kevin, who has earlier wished his family away, discovers that he loves and needs them), the film does go some way toward getting the job done.

If only Hughes would learn to relax, to stop selling for a minute and allow his characters a little breathing room.",WF_Doc8_1990-_Home-Alone_,Will Fleurant,Comedy,Negative,Home Alone
179,WF_Doc9__Home-Alone_-Turns,"Bah humbug, the Christmas-themed comedy Home Alone is celebrating its 25th anniversary on Monday. Give me anything holiday related from Its a Wonderful Life to Bad Santa, but dont ever make me see Home Alone again!

By the way, if you do not know this 1990 movie, you might have actually been born yesterday and will need this column read aloud. In any case, Home Alone is the pratfall-filled story of a Midwest American couple (John Heard and Catherine OHara) who inadvertently leave one of their kids alone in their house when flying off for a Christmas vacation in Paris. The abandoned child is an eight-year-old, big-eyed boy named Kevin (Macaulay Culkin). He has to deal with survival issues, including fending off two bumbling burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) while also overcoming his fear of the old codger (Roberts Blossom) living next door. Meanwhile, after discovering their grievous error, members of the McCallister family face logistical challenges in their struggle to get home again.

While recognizing that millions of fans absolutely adore this hit movie from director Chris Columbus and writer-producer John Hughes, I do not. In fact, I detest it with a passion that knows no bounds  and have hated it since I first viewed it at a New York advance screening prior to interviews with cast and crew. This was just before the movies public debut on Nov. 16, 1990. Needless to say, none of the four Home Alone sequels made me happy, either.

My reaction was and still is illogical, I know, but this is emotional. Deeply so. Home Alone is just a movie that crawls under my skin like a virus from an early David Cronenberg horror shocker.

So what is the problem? It starts with kid star Culkin. He was a creepy little kid actor in 1990; now he is a creepy adult musician of some sort. Once considered the most significant child star in Hollywood since Shirley Temple, Culkin has not made a legit movie since Sex and Breakfast in 2007. He does occasionally shuffle into projects with his musician-actor-director friend Adam Green, including playing himself in Greens iPhone flick, The Wrong Ferarri (2011).

But it is now obvious that Macaulay Culkin has absolutely no credibility whatsoever as an adult actor, unlike his younger brother Kieran Culkin, who is currently part of the ensemble for the second season of TVs Fargo. Their father, Christopher Cornelius (Kit) Culkin is a former Broadway stage actor who became an obnoxious manipulator of his kids careers. In 1990, that creeped me out, too.

None of that behind-the-scenes bull should actually matter in watching the movie. Yet it does with Home Alone  in stark contrast with my feeling about the films of Tommy Lee Jones. The curmudgeonly Jones is the meanest man I have ever met in the film business, yet I respect his work. So there must be something else involved with Home Alone beyond my annoyance with Macaulay Culkin. Focus on the theme: Child abandonment should not be a source of this kind of comedy. Yet, in another contradiction, I can laugh when Seth MacFarlane treats every kind of family issue, including child abuse and abandonment, with gleeful disdain.

Speaking of MacFarlanes Family Guy, one of his infamous cut-aways spoofed Home Alone by rewriting the break-and-enter scenes with competent robbers who side-step the boys booby traps and soon shoot the animated version of Kevin in the head. Well, one dude says to another, now there are no witnesses! Nuff said.",WF_Doc9__Home-Alone_-Turns,Will Fleurant,Comedy,Negative,Home Alone

The dual personas provide a powerful stage for Nyong’o, who deserves Oscar consideration for Lead Actress six years after her Supporting Actress win for “12 Years a Slave” (2013). She essentially has to play two roles: one as a traumatized middle-class mother, one as a hoarse-throated shadow figure, but both with protective maternal instincts. You’ll instantly recall Daniel Kaluuya’s teacup hypnosis as Nyong’o keeps her eyes “Peeled” in bulging, teary terror.



The same goes for Duke (“Black Panther”), who dons a Howard University sweatshirt and glasses to crack goofy dad jokes, then shifts to farsighted squints and primal moans as his shadow double. Most impressive are the child actors, as Joseph plays teenage innocence before shifting to a freaky frozen grin, and Alex playfully wears a plastic Halloween mask before shifting to his pyromaniac duplicate to wear a much creepier, canvas-style mask.



Peele was inspired by the “Mirror Image” episode of “The Twilight Zone” (1960), which he is rebooting this spring. Cinephiles will also notice shades of Don Siegel’s “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” (1956), Michael Bay’s “The Island” (2005) and Charlie McDowell’s “The One I Love” (2014), which fittingly starred Elisabeth Moss (“Mad Men”) in a double role. She returns in “Us” with Tim Heidecker (“Tim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!”) as the wealthy parents of twins.



Directing duplicates requires a carefully constructed dance of body doubles and over-the-shoulder trick shots — just ask Tatiana Maslany in BBC’s “Orphan Black” (2013) and J.K. Simmons in Starz’s “Counterpart” (2017). But it’s worth the challenge, as it provides endless possibilities for dynamic direction. In “Us,” Peele presents Nyong’o’s face pressed against her reflection in the cracking glass of a coffee table, a high-angle shot of the family on the beach with long shadows stretching across the sand, and the distorted images of funhouse mirrors.



The latter-most is the most disturbing in a masterful opening boardwalk sequence, where Peele blends the whistling child danger of Fritz Lang’s “M” (1931) with the beach terror of “Jaws” (1975), right down to Jason wearing a “Jaws” T-shirt (Peele reportedly asked Spielberg for permission). The fact that Young Adelaide wears a Michael Jackson “Thriller” T-shirt is even creepier after the King of Pop’s pedophilia allegations in HBO’s “Leaving Neverland” (2019).



Note the way that Peele constructs this sequence: (A) Young Adelaide’s face moves from light to dark (i.e. film noir), as she descends the stairs to the beach; (B) Lightning eerily flashes in the night sky in the distance; (C) An insert shot shows a candy apple abandoned in the sand as a few rain drops start to fall; (D) The rain lets loose in a downpour as Young Adelaide stands alone in the chiaroscuro-lit doorway of the fun house before plunging into a dark hellscape.



The film’s next big set piece, the home invasion by the doppelgängers, is equally masterful, playing on the same fears of intrusion as “Night of the Living Dead” (1968), “The Evil Dead” (1981), “Scream” (1996), “Funny Games” (1997), “The Others” (2001), “The Strangers” (2008) and “The Purge” (2013). This is where you’ll clutch your date on the edge of your seat.



And then, the film’s tone frustratingly starts to shift, becoming less of the slow-burn suspense we got in “Get Out” and more of the lowest-common-denominator schlock we’ve seen from zombies and vampires of monster movies past. Act 2 still offers moments of bloody delight and inspired choices, particularly a bubbly soundtrack that runs counterpoint to the grisly action, like Kubrick’s use of “Singin’ in the Rain” in “A Clockwork Orange” (1971). Here, it’s the Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations,” which cuts to a hilarious Alexa joke that we refuse to spoil.



Not only does the tone shift, the “rules of magic” slowly start to unravel with plot holes and logical inconsistencies that undermine the otherwise brilliant twists of Act 3. For instance, why do some dopplegangers move in unison with the humans (i.e. the son), while others are able to move freely? By the end, their exact origins remain sketchy even after the ultimate reveal.



The entire construct feels half-baked and not fully formed. By the time we reach the White Swan vs. Black Swan ballerina showdown a la “Black Swan” (2010), we wish that Peele would have given the script another rewrite or two to flesh out the story logic. While “Get Out” sent us out of the theater in awe, many viewers will leave “Us” scratching their heads in confusion.



Don’t worry, there are still plenty of Peele’s symbolic visual staples: reproductive rabbits, untethering scissors, the speedboat name “Craw Daddy,” toy ambulances and the numbers 11:11, including the time on digital clocks, an 11-11 baseball score and the mystery Bible verse Jeremiah 11:11: “Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.”



This doom exists from the opening image of a TV set (i.e. “Poltergeist”) showing a 1986 “Hands Across America” commercial, which comes full circle in the closing image as a subversive analogy for President Donald Trump’s border wall. When the shadow family is asked their identity, they simply respond, “We are Americans.” Thus, the title “Us” should be read as “U.S.”



This larger social commentary is timely, exposing the class divides of two parallel worlds, one of privilege, one of plight, unfolding in simultaneous realities. And yet, like Darren Aronofsky’s “mother!” (2017), the underlying metaphors never fully gel with the surface-level A-story plot, which is what “Get Out” did so well, marrying the surface ride with the hidden symbolic layers.



“Us” is more of a straight slasher genre piece, for better or worse, but it’s no sophomore slump because it proves Peele’s vocabulary of consistent auteur trademarks. If we watched it before “Get Out,” the result might have impressed us as a lowbrow horror/comedy by one half of Key & Peele. But now that we’re watching it after the elevated experience of “Get Out,” there’s a slight air of disappointment selfishly crying out, “Another masterpiece please!”



Alas, you can’t hit a home run every time. “Us” is still very much worth a watch — a genius firing on most cylinders is a better use of your time than lesser filmmakers at their best. Just expect a suspenseful, nightmarish, even puzzling ride with more questions than answers. I have a hunch audience scores are going to be more mixed than the critical raves thus far.



What we have here is M. Night Shyamalan after his “Sixth Sense” breakthrough akin to “Get Out.” Plenty of juicy twists await, but can anything ever match it? Either way, it’s exciting to have a new auteur in the horror genre where we can’t wait to see what he does next.",DM_Doc10_Us_Negative,Danish Moti,Horror,Negative,Us

“Therefore this is what the Lord says: ‘I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them.” - Jeremiah 11:11



In Rodney Ascher’s  documentary “Room 237,” four theorists attempt to explain the hidden messages in Stanley Kubrick’s movie “The Shining.” The ideas about what the movie is about range from the possible to the downright bizarre. One theory fixates on the possibility that “The Shining” was Kubrick’s way of confessing he faked the landing on the moon footage, and another obsesses over the details of the hedge maze. The other two see evidence that the 1980 film indirectly references either the genocide of Native Americans or the Holocaust.



Like “The Shining,” there are a number of different ways to interpret Jordan Peele’s excellent new horror movie, “Us.” Every image seems to be a clue for what’s about to happen or a stand-in for something outside the main story of a family in danger. Peele’s film, which he directed, wrote and produced, will likely reward audiences on multiple viewings, each visit revealing a new secret, showing you something you missed before in a new light.



“Us” begins back in 1986 with a young girl and her parents wandering through the Santa Cruz boardwalk at night. She separates from them to walk out on the empty beach, watching a foreboding flock of thunderclouds roll in. Her eyes find an attraction just off the main pier, and she walks into what looks like an abandoned hall of mirrors, discovering something deeply terrifying—her doppelgänger. The movie shifts to the present day, with Janelle Monae on the radio as the Wilson family is heading towards their vacation home. The little girl has now grown up to be a woman, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong’o), nervous about returning to that spot on the Santa Cruz beach. Her husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), thinks her reaction is overblown, but he tries to make her feel at ease so they can take their kids Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex) to the beach and meet up with old friends, the Tylers (Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker) and their twin daughters. After one small scare and a few strange coincidences on the beach, the family returns home for a quiet night in, only to have their peace broken by a most unlikely set of trespassers lined up across their driveway: doppelgängers of their family.



Part of the appeal of “Us” is how you interpret what all of this information and images mean. No doubt the movie will give audiences plenty to mull over long after the credits. In the film, the Jeremiah 11:11 Bible verse appears twice before pivotal moments, and there are plenty of other Biblical references to dig into, including an analogy to heaven and hell. Perhaps Jason’s “Jaws” shirt is a reference to the rocket sweater the little boy wears in “The Shining” or it could be a warning about the film’s oceanside dangers. In the ‘80s scene, when young Adelaide walks into the mysterious attraction, the sign welcoming her is that of a Native American in a headdress above the name “Shaman Vision Quest.” When the family returns to the beach, the sign has been replaced with a more PC-friendly sign bearing a wizard advertising it as “Merlin’s Enchanted Forest,” a bandaid solution to hiding the racist exterior and the horror inside its halls.  



As he did with “Get Out,” Peele pays significant tribute to the films that have influenced him in “Us.” Though this time, there doesn’t seem to be a consensus. As I spoke with others who saw the movie, we focused on different titles that stood out to us. For me, “The Shining” looked to be the film that received the most nods in “Us,” including an overhead shot of the Wilson family driving through hilly forests to their vacation home, much like the Torrance family does on the way to the Overlook Hotel. There’s also a reference to “The Shining” twins, a few architectural and cinematography similarities and, in one shot, Nyong’o charges the camera with a weapon much like Jack Nicholson menacingly drags along an ax in a chase. However, “Us” is not just a love letter to one horror movie. Peele also pays tribute to Brian De Palma with a split diopter shot that places both Adelaide and her doppelgänger in equal focus for the first time in the movie. There’s also a tip of the hat to Darren Aronofsky’s “Black Swan” in terms of dueling balletic styles and a gorgeously choreographed fight scene that looks like a combative pas de deux.



This delightfully deranged home invasion-family horror film works because Peele not only knows how to tell his story, he assembled an incredible cast to play two roles. The Wilsons are a picture of an all-American family: a family of four that looks to be middle class, with college-educated (Gabe is wearing a Howard University sweater) parents doting on their two children. Their doppelgängers may look like them and be tied to them in some way, but their lives are inverses of each other, and their existence has been one of limits and misery. It’s one of the most poignant analogies of class in America to come out in a studio film in recent memory. For the actors, it’s a chance to play two extremes, one of intense normality and the other of wretched evil. In “Us,” Duke shows off his comedic strengths as the dorky father who often embarrasses his kids, and his doppelgänger is a frighting wall of violence with little to say other than grunts and fighting his adversary. If Nyong’o doesn’t get some professional recognition for her performances here, I will be very disappointed. As Adelaide, she’s fearful, trying to keep some traumatic memories at bay but putting on a brave face for her family. To play her character’s opposite, Nyong’o adopts a graceful, confident movement for her doppelgänger, sliding into the family’s home with scissors at the ready. The doppelgänger looks wide-eyed and maliciously curious as if she’s looking for new ways to terrorize this family. She whispers in a raspy but sinister voice that would make many people jump and run away.



A suspenseful story and marvelous cast need a great crew to make the film a home run, and “Us” is not short on talent. “It Follows” cinematographer Mike Gioulakis creates unsettling images in mundane spaces, like how a strange family standing at a driveway isn’t necessarily scary, but when it’s eerily dark out, they’re backlit so that their faces go unseen and the four bodies are standing at a higher elevation from our heroes, so it looks like evil is swooping in from above. Kym Barrett’s costume designs not only supply the doppelgängers’ nefarious looking red jumpsuits but also the normal, comfy clothes the Wilsons and Tylers wear on vacation. Michael Abels, who also composed the score for “Get Out,” and the ominous notes from the sound design team lay the groundwork for nerve-wracking sequences.



Jordan Peele isn’t the next Kubrick, M. Night Shyamalan, Alfred Hitchcock or Steven Spielberg. He’s his own director, with a vision that melds comedy, horror and social commentary. And he has a visual style that’s luminous, playful and delightfully unnerving. Peele uses an alternate cinematic language to Kubrick, seems more comfortable at teasing his story’s twists throughout the narrative unlike Shyamalan, uses suspense differently than Hitchcock, and possesses the comedic timing Spielberg never had. “Us” is another thrilling exploration of the past and oppression this country is still too afraid to bring up. Peele wants us to talk, and he’s given audiences the material to think, to feel our way through some of the darker sides of the human condition and the American experience.

There’s an enlightening recent documentary, Horror Noire, which traces the history of black horror cinema through years of metaphorical monsters, gross stereotyping and degrading blacksploitation silliness, a history in which a black actor’s character rarely survived past the halfway point of a horror movie and their lines were 50 percent the word “damn”.



Tellingly, the watershed moment Horror Noire uses to begin its narrative is from 2017’s Get Out, Jordan Peele’s debut film as writer and director, and one which won him an Oscar for best script – something few horror films have ever managed. The terror in the pictured scene, say the commentators – is that felt by a person of colour in a white, affluent, suburban neighbourhood, which is not something that had been captured on film before.



Peele’s long-awaited follow-up, Us, is no less revolutionary, but it is less explicit in its messaging. The political point here is simple: the protagonists in Us, the middle class family at the heart of the action, the lovable Winstons, are black. There’s a shy boy, a confident girl, a goofy all-American dad (Winston Duke) and a mother with a secret (Lupita Nyong’o). They’re not slasher fodder – they’re the ones you’re rooting for. It shouldn’t be progressive, but it is.



Us plays on the trope of the home invasion film, a modern horror staple that strikes to the very heart of the American psyche – Bad people! Horrible ones! In your property! Now! And your WiFi has gone down!!! But this is a Jordan Peele script, and therefore there is a twist: the people invading the family’s home look exactly like the Winstons, but wearing red jumpsuits and carrying scissors. You can guess what they do with the scissors.



As horror conceits go, it’s a deeply creepy one – especially when Nyong’o’s ‘red’ mother begins speaking, unleashing a pained, guttural, dusty drawl. Horror films can often be seen as a doss job for a Hollywood star – if ever there’s a time to phone in a performance, it’s there – but Nyong’o gives it the full Oscar-winner effort, shaping out two fully rounded characters: the mother and her evil alter-ego.



As each member of the family must individually confront their own doppelganger, there are battles, there are jump scares and there are plenty of laughs too, which can often be an awkward balance to pull off in a horror film, but one which Jordan Peele excels at.



In fact, there’s plenty of satire here as the film scratches America’s underbelly to find the shadows behind the American dream. The initial setting for the horror – Santa Cruz boardwalk – is somewhere that’s meant to be fun, but every Lost Boys fan knows that it is, of course, full of damn vampires. There, a young Adelaide Wilson, played as an adult by Nyong’o, wins a Michael Jackson T-shirt, a symbol of the fallen hero. Music is used brilliantly too: ’90s hip hop banger ‘I Got Five On It’ by Luniz appears first when the family are singing along in the car. Later, its ominous chords thunder out whenever danger is present. Peele shows us horror among the familiar, and it’s all the more scary as a result.



Alas, Us is not perfect. Towards the end of the film, the concept becomes a little stretched, even by its own internal logic. But it’s a film that confirms Peele as that rarest of things – a true auteur.",DM_Doc2_Us_Positive,Danish Moti,Horror,Positive,Us

Director Jordan Peele follows up the Oscar-winning success of his social thriller “Get Out” with a trip to the “Twilight Zone.” No, not his reboot of the famous anthology series (that will come to small screens later this year) but to a storyline he says was inspired by an episode of the Eisenhower-era show called “Mirror Image.”



According to Rod Serling’s original opening monologue when look-a-likes torment a young woman, “circumstances assault Millicent Barnes’s (played by “Psycho’s” Vera Miles) sense of reality and a chain of nightmares will put her sanity on a block.”



Peele updates the doppelgänger danger premise but also ups the horror elements to tell the story of a trip gone wrong for the Wilsons, overprotective mom Adelaide (Lupita Nyong’o), goofy dad Gabe (Winston Duke) and young kids Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex).



On vacation in Adelaide ‘s hometown of Santa Cruz, site of an upsetting incident when she was a child, the young mom is tormented the past. Her attempts to squash the unhappy memories have been unsuccessful and now she is troubled by the fear that something bad will happen to her family if they don’t pack up and head home. “I can’t be here,” she says. “It’s too much. I feel like there’s a black cloud hanging over me and I don’t feel quite like myself.”



Her worst nightmares come true when strange beings in red jumpsuits, carrying scissors, show up in their driveway. The really creepy part? They call themselves the Tethered because they look like each member of the Wilson family. When they invade the house, the horror is kicked up a notch or three. “They look exactly like us,’ says Adelaide. “They think like us. They know where we are. We need to move and keep moving. They won’t stop until they kill us… or we kill them.”



When the family first spies the mysterious family in the driveway Gabe puts on a brave face. “Let’s all stay calm,” he says. But this isn’t the kind of movie where people stay calm. Especially when feral shadow people with a grudge against anyone who grew up in the light are out for revenge. The Wilsons are a nice family confronted by something they could not imagine, let alone control. “How many of anybody are there going to be,” asks little Jason.



Peele proves, as if there was any doubt, that “Get Out” was not a fluke. He skilfully navigates “Us’s” story, establishing the Wilsons as a regular, likable family with a teen daughter prone to rolling her eyes and a father who’s always quick with a dad joke. When the going gets grim Peele uses ingenuity, humour, a creepy kid choral score and some very scary images to add life to what might have been a simple home invasion movie. From the opening scenes in a California carnival to an audaciously choreographed climax, Poole crafts a memorable horror film with a message.



For much of the film it’s the Wilsons against the world but soon the subtext sinks in. The Tethered aren’t exact replicas of the Wilsons, they are the Wilsons if they didn’t have advantages—education, money—and they are here to get what they think they deserve. It’s a gory take on class structure, on the chasm between rich and poor, between those with power and advantages and those without. It’s an outlandish story but the powerful message resonates in Trump era America.



“Us” is given it’s humanity by Nyong’o’s Adelaide. Even when she’s cracking heads with a fireplace poker she has compassion. She is by times a mom, a monster, a victim and the aggressor but never less than compelling. For too long women of colour have been dispensable in genre films. Nyong’o’s deft touch makes one hopeful for more colour-blind casting in the horror and fantasy genres, even if the overall tone of this film is one of hopelessness.",DM_Doc3_Us_Positive,Danish Moti,Horror,Positive,Us

In his 1983 stand-up comedy special Delirious, Eddie Murphy struts the stage in Thriller-era red leathers and ponders why, precisely, white families in horror movies bother lingering in haunted houses. Black people, in Murphy’s estimation, would immediately beat a hasty retreat at the slightest inkling of a forbidding presence. The story goes that Murphy’s joke – and in particular his imagined ghost’s warning to “get out”– planted a seed in the fertile mind of comedian-turned-master-of-horror Jordan Peele.



Peele’s remarkable 2017 feature film debut offered a sophisticated response to Murphy’s challenge. Black people, Get Out argued, can’t simply vacate the proverbial premises because the conditions of their entrapment are present even in the sunny-seeming setting of a superficially welcoming, allegedly “postracial” America. Conceived during the Obama administration but premiering days after the Trump inauguration, Get Out’s premise, and its ability to deliver on it with finely calibrated scares, haunting imagery, and canny satire, hammered a chord. The film minted a fortune, earned accolades (including a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for Peele), and instantly enmeshed itself in the contemporary cultural vocabulary. For as long as there are people writing about horror, and satire, and race in America, there will be people writing about Get Out.



Expectations for Peele’s follow-up were skewed accordingly. Yet any rumours that his sophomore outing, Us, is “just” a straight-ahead scare-fest seem exaggerated. Although it is foremost a highly entertaining and well-executed horror movie, Us is shot through with its own strain of social criticism. Here the subject is not race, but class, with the film introducing an underworld of voiceless doppelgangers armed with lethal scissors and clad in blood-red onesies that recall, all at once, prison uniforms, working class coveralls and, yes, Delirious-era Murphy.



The film opens on the Santa Cruz boardwalk circa 1986, where a father wins a prize (a baggy Thriller T-shirt, no less – here Peele lucks into his zeitgeistiness) for his young daughter. Ignored by her quarrelling parents, the child ambles into a hall of mirrors, where she meets another a girl, who appears to be her exact double. Cut to 30 years later, and the girl is now a married mother of two played by Lupita Nyong’o, back in sunny Santa Cruz for a beach holiday with her own family. In a film abounding with imagery of doubles, mirrors, rhymes and reflections, it should be no surprise that history repeats itself, with Nyong’o’s young son wandering near the same carnival attraction, and baiting a clan of (almost) exact doubles of his entire family back to their beach house.



From here, Peele develops a genuinely thrilling, heart-in-the-throat-scary horror picture. The archly creepy doubles – called “the Tethered,” after the manner in which they are existentially bound to their above-ground versions, like shadows – are a monster worthy of the Universal logo that precedes the film’s opening titles. Peele exhibits a mastery of his camera, of managing suspense, and of teasing (and rewarding) the intimation of violence. He’s also an exceptionally talented director of actors. Nyong’o’s physicality in her dual role as both herself and her Tether is revelatory. (Also excellent: Winston Duke as her husband, whose manner suggests a burlier on-screen surrogate for Peele himself; and Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss as their gaucher, more garishly wealthy friends.)

Nyong’o’s physicality in her dual role as both herself and her Tether is revelatory.



CLAUDETTE BARIUS/UNIVERSAL STUDIOS



Peele possesses a distinct talent for handling horror and comedy simultaneously, such that jokes landing in the midst of sustained suspense and wanton violence feel both natural and cathartic. There are multiple scenes in which pitched screams descend into fits of laughter, which feels like as fine a trademark for writer/director/producer Peele as his recurring image of a single tear dripping down a face seized by abject terror.



Strangely, this sophomore effort feels like more of a proverbial “calling card picture” than Get Out. It’s as if Peele, rattled by his own hype, is straining to show what he can do as a straight-ahead craftsman, absent all the talk of him being a generational talent with a gift for articulating the issues vexing America. The film’s critique of classism – present not only in the central family’s war against the Tethered, but their hostility toward Heidecker and Moss’s family, with their Botox and smart-home and more souped-up holiday boat rental – is undercooked. In Get Out, the terror, the comedy, and the commentary all felt as if they were producing one another. With Us, it’s as if Peele is struggling to find a contemporary issue onto which he can overlay his horror movie. (You can’t spell “Us” without “U.S.,” and so on.)



Add to this the film’s belaboured mise-en-scène, which telescopes its themes without anything in the way of subtlety. An opening sequence depicting an 80s-vintage home entertainment console adorned with VHS tapes of C.H.U.D., The Goonies, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and The Man With Two Brains (in which Steve Martin is telepathically linked with a separate brain), serve to twitchily wink at the film’s notion of a bifurcated underworld/overworld structure. Such touches might dazzle in their initial density and deliberateness, but they’re unlikely to generate much in the way of analysis outside of dopey “20 Things You Might Have Missed In Us” YouTube videos.



These are not the markers of a bad film – or a bad filmmaker – by any stretch. But where Get Out felt urgent and preternaturally confident, Us is the work of a gifted director who seems to be compensating for having less to say by overstating how he says it. Peele knows his horror movie canon well enough to realize that the best cheapo fright flicks are not only scary and fun, but shaggy enough to invite interpretation, instead of issuing preachy messaging about The State Of The World Today.



In place of the hushed voices of his debut (or of Murphy’s inciting Delirious joke), you can almost hear Peele goading his audience with Us. It’s less “get out” and more “get it?”

Jordan Peele shows he’s a master of horror in his latest film Us, which is “full of small visual touches and references meant to lure viewers back again and again,” writes Caryn James.



The underclass is coming to destroy us, and we will deserve it. That is the simple, overarching message of Jordan Peele’s witty meta-horror film, Us. The ‘us’ he aligns viewers with is a middle-class American family of four, the Wilsons, and ‘they’ are their doppelgangers. The disenfranchised doubles have been living somewhere mysterious, cut off from the comforts of society. This other mother, father and two children appear one night in the Wilsons’ driveway wearing blood-red jumpsuits and wielding large golden scissors, the better to slice up their counterparts. Class warfare has rarely broken out with such frightening panache.  



Despite the film’s veneer of a social theme, Us is different from and less inventive than Get Out, Peele’s amazing debut as writer and director. That film was a scathing critique of racial assumptions and stereotyping, cloaked in comic-horror. Us reverses the formula, and works best as a smart, intricately structured take on that genre, with a message that is plain but never deep. Peele is masterful at the horror part, though. Playfully using classic tropes of the genre while channelling primal fears, Us can make you laugh and cower at once.  



The film starts slowly, which allows Peele to drop clues about what’s to come. Us is full of small visual touches and references meant to lure viewers back again and again to find more. In the opening scene, set in 1986, the camera zones in on a television commercial promoting Hands Across America, a real event in which  people across the country joined hands to raise money for the hungry and homeless. Anyone who has seen the film’s trailer will instantly spot the resemblance between the event’s logo – a row of red cut-out figures, like paper dolls – and the red jumpsuited doppelgangers.



Other references are more obscure. A homeless man with stringy blonde hair holds a sign that says Jeremiah 11:11. He recurs through the film, but Peele leaves it to viewers to go home and look up the Biblical reference on his sign. (It is chilling.)



He is first seen as a theme park, where a small girl wanders into a funhouse hall of mirrors. A sign there reads: “Vision Quest: Find Yourself,” and that’s exactly what she finds. Little Adelaide spots her doppelganger, and is terrified from that day on.



The slight differences in the doppelgangers are more alarming than exact duplicates might have been

When the film leaps to the present, Adelaide is Lupita Nyong’o, married to Gabe Wilson (Winston Duke), who adds comic relief as a sometimes oblivious guy who tells bad dad jokes. Their teenage daughter, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), is always on her phone. Their younger child, Jason (Evan Alex) unaccountably wears a mask on top of his head. They are at the family beach house, conveniently near to the scene of Adelaide’s childhood trauma.



The action picks up when the doubles invade the house. Each of the actors has a dual role, and Peele has directed them with such nuance that the slight differences – the doppelgangers’ faces remain still no matter how violent they become – are more alarming than exact duplicates might have been. The film centres around Nyong’o, whose performance as the double is especially eerie. Her voice is croaky and halting, as if she has not spoken in years, as she resentfully tells a story about a girl who “had a shadow”. That girl was a princess who found her prince and a happy life, while the shadow was hungry and living in the dark. Joseph brilliantly displays the creepy look on her face as Zora’s evil counterpart. Like Nyong’o’s, her double’s physical movements are as swift and pouncing as an animal’s. 



The family fights off the invaders in scenes that Peele creates with sleek precision. They try to escape by boat and by car. Adelaide thwacks the Others with a fireplace poker – always strangely close at hand in horror films. There are stabbings with scissors, evoking Hitchcock. The melodramatic music cues, calling attention to danger in the style of old movies, signal that Us is a meta-layer removed from those hokey films, that the urge to yell, “Don’t go down that dark road alone!” is a trick Peele has knowingly set up. Even as the scenes become a bloody mess, the film is always lucid, cutting from wide shots of corpses to suspenseful angles seen from the besieged family members’ points of view.  



The film takes an unexpected, spectacular stylistic turn

Peele keeps ramping up the intensity of the action, but then the film takes an unexpected, spectacular stylistic turn. As we come close to understanding the secret behind Adelaide’s funhouse encounter, the film becomes more imagistic, almost surreal. The music is thumping and modern, and we see young Adelaide and her double dancing in ballet classes. Those scenes bring the film Black Swan to mind, rather than slasher movies. The sequence is a revelation, evidence that Peele can be an exceptional film-maker in an entirely different mode.



Even though Us leans into its genre, social issues linger as subtext. The Wilsons are black, but their race is not addressed as an issue. The exception is a scene in which Gabe confronts the doubles in the driveway and deliberately changes his grammar to sound thuggish, using the image of the threatening black man as a ploy. Even then, the film leaves it to viewers to infer the comment on racial stereotyping.



Peele himself has been blunt about how the film deals with America. “This country, and how this country looks at the world, we have a fear of the outsider,” he has said, describing his theme. “No one really wants to look at their faults, their guilt, their demons.” By the end, Hands Across America, a well-intentioned event, has been subverted into a symbol of evil. The most chilling lesson from Us: you just might be your own evil twin.",DM_Doc5_Us_Positive,Danish Moti,Horror,Positive,Us

Writer-director Jordan Peele’s 2017 Get Out was a brash and intriguing debut, a picture that wrestled with the notion of whether or not America can ever be a post-racial society: Vital and spooky, it refused to hand over easy answers. With the ambitious home-invasion horror chiller Us, Peele goes even deeper into the conflicted territory of class and race and privilege; he also ponders the traits that make us most human. But this time, he’s got so many ideas he can barely corral them, let alone connect them. He overthinks himself into a corner, and we’re stuck there with him.



Lupita Nyong’o stars as Adelaide, who has overcome a traumatic childhood experience and now has a family of her own, including husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two kids: graceful, well-adjusted Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and the slightly more awkward Jason (Evan Alex), who wears a wolfman mask pushed up on his head as a kind of security blanket. We meet the comfortably middle-class Wilson family as they’re heading off on vacation to Santa Cruz, the site of Adelaide’s childhood ordeal. On their first night away, they look out and see a family of four, mute and stony echoes of themselves, standing in the driveway. From there, Peele unspools a story of “shadow” people, long forced to live underground but now streaming to the Earth’s surface to claim, violently, what they feel is rightfully theirs.



The effectiveness of Us may depend on how little you know about it going in, so the spoiler-averse may wish to stop reading here. But it’s impossible to address any of the movie’s larger ideas without giving away key plot points: Before long, that shadow family has infiltrated the house, and now that we can get a good look, we see that each of them is a not-quite-right replica of a Wilson, dressed in a red jumpsuit and wielding a pair of menacing-looking shears. At one point a terrified Adelaide asks the other mother, a twin of herself but with vacant, crazy eyes and a demented smile, “What are you people?” “We are Americans,” the lookalike responds, in a whispery growl.



That’s a bright, neon-lit Author’s Message if ever there was one, though the idea of using a group of sunlight-deprived semi-zombies as a metaphorical element in a parable about class complacency isn’t necessarily a bad one. Are you and your family doing great? Do you live in a nice place, drive an expensive car, and have plenty of food for everyone to eat? Be grateful for it. But be aware that there are others who, through no fault of their own, don’t live at the same comfort level—or are, in fact, barely surviving. (The Wilsons also have close friends, Josh and Kitty, played by Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss, who have more money and nicer stuff than they do, a source of irritation for Gabe in particular, and another of the movie’s threads about class consciousness in America.) But Peele doesn’t always lay out his ideas clearly. Us isn’t always fun to watch; there are stretches where it’s plodding and dour. He’s overly fond of heavy-duty references, including Biblical ones: A creepy dude holds a sign that reads Jeremiah 11:11. (If you don’t know it outright, it’s the one that goes, “Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.”) The mood of Us is sometimes chilling, but even then, you’re not always sure what, exactly, is chilling you. Maybe it’s just the feeling of being trapped in an over-air-conditioned lecture hall, because there’s a strain of preachiness running through the whole thing.



One thing that’s unquestionable: Peele is a dazzling visual stylist. (Peele’s cinematographer is Mike Gioulakis, who also shot David Robert Mitchell’s It Follows, as well as M. Night Shyamalan’s Split and Glass.) The movie’s opening, which details young Adelaide’s nightmare—it takes place in a ghoulish hall of mirrors on the Santa Cruz boardwalk—is a mini-horror masterpiece by itself, an evocation of the outright weirdness of childhood rather than its wonder: As the girl wanders away from her parents, in an almost trancelike state, she clutches a candied apple so shiny it’s like blood-red crystal ball—and puts us in a trance, too.



Yet the rest of Us is laden with metaphors, and they pile up so quickly that not even Peele can keep up with them. The movie repeatedly references Hands Across America, a 1986 benefit event in which some 6.5 million people joined hands along a route mapped out across the contiguous United States. (Many participants had donated $10 to reserve a space in the chain; the money was donated to local charities dedicated to fighting hunger and ending poverty.) In Us, the shadow people form a similar chain. But it’s hard to know what Peele is trying to say with that image. Are the semi-zombies of Us just less fortunate versions of us? Are they actually us and we don’t know it? Is their clumsy anger somehow superior to thought and reason? After all, it has unified them, while we aboveground humans are more divided than ever.



How, in the end, are we supposed to feel about these shadow people, for so long deprived of basic human rights—including daylight—that they have become murderous clones? Sometimes great movies are ambiguous, but ambiguity resulting from unclear thinking makes nothing great. It’s one thing for a movie to humble you by leaving you unsure about yourself and your place in the world; it’s another for it to leave you wondering what, exactly, a filmmaker is trying to use his formidable verbal and visual vocabulary to say",DM_Doc6_Us_Negative,Danish Moti,Horror,Negative,Us

Watching the new film Us, Jordan Peele’s hotly anticipated follow-up to his Oscar-winning smash hit Get Out, got me thinking about Magnolia—Paul Thomas Anderson’s hotly anticipated follow-up to his defining second film, Boogie Nights—which will have its 20th anniversary this year. Like Magnolia, Us arrives blessed with a bigger budget and laden with the hope that the director, in all his newfound freedom to explore and express the landscape of his mind, will deliver the next great gospel. What results from all that expectation, one founded on a still-molten legacy, is a mad riot of ideas and motifs, a messy gush of a movie. As Magnolia did two decades ago, Us does now.



Only, Magnolia made engaging, legible enough art out of its abundance. Us, on the other hand, is a frustrating movie, oddly inert despite all its thrashing. It’s a jumble of fascinating threads that Peele fails to weave together. It’s what you might call a junk-drawer movie, a collage of bits and bobs that have cluttered Peele’s brilliant mind for long enough that he thought he might try to synthesize them all into one movie. But the ball of rubber bands doesn’t really speak to the bottle-opener thingy; the eyeglass screwdriver doesn’t have much to do with the Ethernet cable. Each item has its own value, sure, but they don’t form a whole equal to the sum of the parts.



Us is about a lot of things—or, rather, indicates toward a lot of things, without really being fully about any of them. It concerns a family—mom Adelaide (Lupita Nyong’o), dad Gabe (Nyong’o’s Black Panther co-star Winston Duke), daughter Zora (the remarkably expressive Shahadi Wright Joseph), and son Jason (Evan Alex)—on vacation together. They drive a nice car, and the family home they’re staying in, near the coast of California, is well-appointed. They seem happy, prosperous. But just beneath the surface is an unease. Adelaide is wary of the whole trip; as a child, she had a mysterious experience at a beachside amusement park, a lingering trauma that sets the early notes of dread in Us.



That ominous scene, a prologue taking place in 1986, is really well staged. Peele is an inventive visual filmmaker, tilting his actors’ heads and bodies at curious angles (he does this throughout, to sometimes breathtaking effect), and imbuing his pictures with a kind of saturated glare. This opening sequence, when young Adelaide (Madison Curry) goes wandering alone into the beginnings of a nightmare, suggests that Us is headed somewhere focused and gripping, a fable of innocence lost and a dark world uncorked. The movie starts with such promise.



But as Peele gradually lays out the mechanics and components of Us, that early jolt dissipates. Us is, I think, among other things, a vague statement on inequity and class struggle, framed as a sort of unconscious Eloi vs. Morlocks system of oppression that breaks into terrible rebellion. That’s certainly a worthy allegory to tackle in this age of economic and social atomization. But Peele is both too literal and not specific enough in that inquest, showing us some hard, tangible things, while remaining coy about what those things really are and what they might mean. Cinema can, of course, be confusing and yet still inspired, erratic and discursive but still piercing. Peele needn’t dull his wild interest any. But his sophomore exuberance, unbridled and running rampant around so many beautifully lit spaces, trips him up. Little in Us lands with the wallop it should—neither the faint and meandering sociopolitical observations nor the film’s baser, more visceral aspects.



This is, after all, a horror movie, and could at least do the job of scaring us, even if it couldn’t quite connect on its deeper intentions. Peele has paced and structured Us awkwardly, though, making it hard to get hooked on the movie’s rhythm. We’re thrown into the middle of something terrifying without any build; even the jump scares (which need their own kind of build) are curiously weightless. What’s missing is true suspense, which comes from trusting a film’s concept of itself, having faith that it knows how it coils and ticks all the way to the finish, and can thus carry us precisely along its rails toward something cathartic and satisfying. But Us is too busy with asides and allusions to really give us that confidence, to truly dial in on the moment. It’s all too eager to hurry up and show us the next cool or crazy thing.



It pains me to say this. I spent a good deal of Us straining to like it, to get on its slightly preening wavelength, to be nourished by its heady stew of tropes. I couldn’t get there, though. As loaded up on stuff as Us is, there’s not enough to grab on to; it’s an alienating idea piece that lumbers away just as it’s about to reveal its true nature. It’s wonderful seeing Nyong’o get such a substantial lead role (well, lead roles, really) after so much of her post-Oscar career has steered her toward the sidelines; she tears into the material with a compelling hunger. That’s certainly one reason to celebrate Us, even if so much of what surrounds Nyong’o is a lopsided war between style and substance. If only those elements could take inspiration from the film’s title and work together. Oh, well. I have no doubt that Peele will find that harmony again someday soon.",DM_Doc7_Us_Negative,Danish Moti,Horror,Negative,Us

Get Out was one of the most talked-about and commonly dissected horror films of the decade and it thrust first-time director Jordan Peele firmly into the spotlight. Now, two years later, Peel has answered the “what’s next?” question with Us, an uneven film that calls to mind a common pitfall in the movie industry often referred to as the Sophomore Slump. Despite an intriguing premise and a single great sequence, Us is a muddled affair that goes off the rails the more Peele tries to expand, explore, and explain his basic concept. It’s often said that less is more in horror and, had Peele cut out a lion’s share of the exposition in Us, it would have made for a more viscerally satisfying experience.



Following a creepy prologue set in a Santa Cruz amusement park circa 1986, Us jumps forward in time to “today.” A family of four – father Gabe (Winston Duke), mother Adelaide (Lupita Nyong’o), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and son Jason (Evan Alex) – are about to embark on the annual ritual of a summer vacation at the lake. Most of Us’ first half-hour is devoted to establishing how normal the Wilsons are. When they arrive at the lake house, Zora complains that she can’t get on-line. Gabe buys a cheap boat. Us gets the family-bonding details right; however, this being a horror film, as night follows day, so unpleasantness trails normalcy.



It begins during a power outage with a creepy quartet standing mutely at the end of the driveway, their intentions as hidden by darkness as their countenances. Adelaide is immediately worried but Gabe is more laid-back in his approach. However, when the strangers don’t respond to his friendly challenges, he tells his wife to call the police and returns outside brandishing a bat. That’s when the home invasion begins – a terrifically crafted 15-minute sequence in which intercutting shows the fate of each member of the Wilson family as the situation unfolds. There’s some exposition included here as well – an explanation of why the invaders resemble the victims. They are the “shadows” and they have come with the intention of untethering themselves from their hosts. That can be accomplished only by using scissors. Peele makes sure we don’t miss the haves-and-have-nots message here by hammering it home with little attempt at subtlety. “What are you?” asks the affluent black woman of her downtrodden shadow. “We’re Americans,” she responds.



The creepiness factor alone keeps the first half of Us involving. Then things start going bonkers…and not in a good way. Although never as whacked out as mother!, Us trends in that direction with some plot twists/developments that don’t make sense. Logic be damned, however – this movie has metaphors. It’s saying something. To make matters worse, Peele doesn’t stick to the rules he establishes. After making it clear that the “shadows” are human, he violates that tenet almost immediately. Us embraces horror movie clichés (like the dead not staying dead and supposedly intelligent people doing stupid things) with glee – at times, this seems to be done tongue-in-cheek but not always. There’s a fair amount of wit and humor (most of which is intentional) in the proceedings but, outside of the home invasion sequence, there’s not enough tension or suspense. Whereas Get Out made viewers feel uncomfortable, the only discomfort emerging from Us is the realization of how little sense everything makes. Putting aside one feeble jump-scare, Peele doesn’t seem interested or invested in frightening viewers. He’s too busy preaching.



As was the case with Get Out, Peele has stayed away from Big Name Actors in casting Us. Instead, he has reached into the MCU and plucked out Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong’o and Winston Duke, both of whom appeared in Black Panther. They’re very good here with Nyong’o focused on her character’s emotional turmoil and Duke providing a portion of the film’s comedic relief (along with a few one-liners that come out of the Schwarzenegger school of instant quotables). Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex, who represent the next generation, get their opportunities to wreak havoc.



If there’s one thing that saves Us, it’s that, even as the movie descends into a narrative morass from which it never escapes, there are many individual scenes that, taken in isolation, pack a punch. The problem is that, once assembled into the larger whole, it doesn’t all work. One would have to be forgiving in the extreme to give Peele a pass by using the justification that all horror films are preposterous. Yes, many are, but not this nonsensical. Us is audacious, to be sure, but audacity isn’t always a good thing.",DM_Doc8_Us_Negative,Danish Moti,Horror,Negative,Us

Us is a second feature from Jordan Peele after his marvellous debut Get Out, which was more brilliantly satirical than scary and may well be the best ever horror film for non-horror people (i.e. me). Us has also garnered five stars everywhere, as well as, at the time of writing, a 100 per cent rating on the aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes, so I’m out of step, I know, but I found it disappointing. The second act is essentially a zombie-style, home-invasion splatterfest that goes on and on and on. Allusions that you think will pay off don’t. It’s ultimately baffling and although I’m fine with baffling as a rule, if I’m going to sit through a zombie-style splatterfest it would have to be for a good reason. 



The opening is terrific. After titles that tell us that there are many tunnels underground in America, we see a small girl wandering away from her parents at Santa Cruz’s beachfront fairground into a hall of mirrors where she appears to meet her exact double. Later flashbacks will show us that this event was so traumatic she was even mute for a period. But, for now, we spool forward in time to meet the Wilson family on the way to their Santa Cruz summer cabin. There’s the mother Adelaide (Lupita Nyong’o), father Gabe (Winston Duke), and two kids (Shahadi Wright Joseph, Evan Alex), and the connection is Adelaide, who was that little girl, and is now reluctant to return to that beach. As the cabin has been in the family ever since her parents’ time, at least, and the Wilsons holiday there annually, you do wonder why this reluctance hasn’t made itself known before, but we’ll leave that there because I know that when I point these things out it’s dreary and gets on fans’ nerves and it shouldn’t matter. (Except it does!)



They do visit the beach, after which their exact doubles spookily turn up in their driveway. They are wearing red overalls and a weird driving glove on one hand, sharp scissors clutched in the other. This is brilliantly achieved and tense. Christ, what will happen now? Something clever, I thought. Something marvellously smart, I further thought. This is Jordan Peele of Get Out.



The Wilsons are friends with a richer, white couple — played by Tim Heidecker and the fabulous Elisabeth Moss — and Gabe has even bought a boat in an attempt to keep up with them, so is this about people being after your life? As expanded to America’s haves and have-nots? Are the tunnels an underclass reference? Or a nod to the Underground Railroad, the 19th-century network of slave escape routes?



The second act is basically just one of prolonged terrorisation and constant bludgeonings with no rules. Some doubles that have been killed, for instance, come back to life and others remain dead. (This shouldn’t matter. Except it does!) I was grateful it wasn’t that frightening but not so grateful that it was quite so repetitively dull.



This isn’t to say that there isn’t anything to admire or that it’s unwatchable. Nyong’o is spellbinding, and when, as her double, she first speaks, as if a razor were stuck in her throat, the blood does chill. And there is an amazing scene concerning Elisabeth Moss and lip gloss. Also, the soundtrack (hip-hop anthems, African rhythms) is wonderful. But nothing coheres. The moments of humour are clunkily inserted. The doubles never amount to much more than your average zombies. And allusions to the bible and rabbits (this out-rabbits even The Favourite) never add up. The ending, which reveals who is really who — that’s all I can say; too spoilery otherwise — makes less sense the more you think about it. Again, I suppose that shouldn’t matter.

190,LCD_Doc10_For-those-who,"For those who like their alien-invasion movies to bludgeon the senses, Pacific Rim fits the bill.

This is Godzilla meets Transformers, with elements of the lesser Star Wars movies, all awash in thunderously loud, non-stop demolition.

While there is some eye-popping production design that occasionally is reminiscent of Blade Runner, this sci-fi adventure (* ½ out of four; rated PG-13; opens Thursday in select theaters and Friday nationwide) descends into mind-numbing mash-ups, with the simplest of stories buried under overbearing special effects.

Legions of gargantuan alien creatures, called Kaiju, emerge from the Pacific Ocean and wreak havoc on coastal areas from Alaska to Australia. Countries bordering the Pacific band together and devise a method of fighting by arming massive robots, called Jaegers, whose movements are controlled by pairs of closely synced pilots.

For the first half-hour or so, the film is exuberant, then spectacle settles into tedium. Following an exceedingly predictable playbook, Pacific gets points for a diverse cast, though no one is allowed to exercise much in the way of acting skills or human appeal. It's essentially all combat all the time, and it's hardly a mystery which side will win.

Directed by Guillermo del Toro, the mastermind behind the hauntingly wonderful Pan's Labyrinth and the rousing Hellboy series, Pacific is surprisingly repetitive and tedious. Clearly influenced by classic Japanese monster movies, del Toro checks all nuance and character development at the door. His focus is solely on creature mayhem. The alien invaders can appear sharklike or, at other times, like dinosaur variations, sometimes sporting octopus tentacles or giant wings.

While fanboys may be delighted, it will not hold the average spectator's attention. Sequences sometimes feel akin to watching people play an intricate video game.

There's a bland romance between Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam), a pilot down on his luck, and Mako (Rinko Kikuchi), a mysterious aspiring flier. They drive an early-model Jaeger in Earth's last hope for survival. In charge of the operation is blustery Jaeger Comm. Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba).



The mind-meld between the two pilots operating the robots is a process known as ""drift."" But if a pilot gets too caught up in memories, it can throw off strategic maneuvers, as it does with both Mako and Raleigh, who have suffered familial losses at the mammoth paws, claws and jaws of the Kaiju. A recurring flashback to Mako's childhood after a particularly shattering attack is the movie's only compelling aspect, recalling some of the emotional horrors of Pan's Labyrinth.

Ordinarily a nuanced actor, Elba spends most of his time bellowing. Hunnam and Kikuchi have no chemistry. Humor is in short supply, arriving only sporadically via Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day), a wacky scientist initially dismissed as a ""Kaiju groupie"" by the cringingly unfunny mathematician Gottlieb (Burn Gorman). Ron Perlman shows up and does little as Hannibal Chau, a guy who traffics in black-market Kaiju parts.

For those not fascinated by two hours of unabated robot vs. alien smackdowns, the movie holds little appeal.",LCD_Doc10_For-those-who,Lekhaj Daggubati,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pacific Rim
191,LCD_Doc1_Once-upon-a,"Once upon a time, going to a mega-movie was a really big deal. The studios spent months winding up the audience with ads, trailers, clips, and toys wrapped in plastic and buried in a box of fast food. People had dreams about characters, built tents in queues outside theaters, and dressed themselves as characters. Mega-movies were special for their size and scale and rumored expense. They featured state-of-the-art effects and maybe involved an alien invasion and were possibly directed by James Cameron. They also seemed relatively rare. You’d get maybe five a year, and you’d get that many only because of the cost and the risk involved in spending that kind of money.

There was also the idea that not every movie should be an event, that if you lost your mind every weekend of every summer you’d have no mind left. So much for that. Now, whether it’s because of our so-called Changing Media Landscape or because the monomaniacs who approve and finance our films are obsessed with making stuff that eats the entire planet, things have changed. Events are all the movies have. The blockbuster threat level has gone from green to blue to Bruckheimer. The mega-budget superproduction owns so many of us. And if we must be owned, and therefore deafened, manhandled, manipulated, exploited, 3-D’d, and forced to watch entire cities reduced to crumbs, then by all means that ownership should be entrusted to those more competent than mere professionals and more committed than certain glorified nerds.

Guillermo del Toro is both — a competent obsessive — but he is also what these sorts of Trump Tower spectacles desperately need. Del Toro is a dreamer. He’s a visionary. If you give him a pile of money to make enormous robots fight enormous monsters at the end of civilization, he will work to make Pacific Rim a movie that makes you feel all the enormousness. He will put you at the feet of the monsters and inside the bellies of the beasts. He will do what a movie about big reptiles and big machines is supposed to do: make you look up, make you feel as if the screen is grossly inadequate to contain what’s on it, even though, if you’re charmed — or strategic — you’re already watching the movie on the biggest screen you possibly can.

Del Toro will attempt to do this for us because many a movie craftsman had done the same for del Toro. Pacific Rim has been dedicated to the legendary creature-effects wizard Ray Harryhausen, who died in the spring, and to Ishiro Honda, the pioneer who gave us, among other kaiju movies, several helpings of Godzilla. It’s hard to describe the tingle of seeing a 100-story-tall object slogging across a skyline and the perverse yearning it provokes, but after my first Godzilla movie, I can remember staring out of windows in anticipation of something that would cause the house to rumble and the treetops to stir.

The creatures in kaiju arose from atomic fear. Would Hiroshima and Nagasaki reoccur? But for a moviegoer lucky enough to be innocent of war and large-scale atrocity, Honda’s radioactive byproducts were just strange creatures — like Harryhausen’s swashbuckling skeletons, howling man-beasts, and hissing serpents — that flourish in the imagination like growing dinosaurs in a glass of water. His movies and their imitators had a strange power. I kept my face pressed against the window. Del Toro delivers the highest-tech tribute to Harryhausen and Honda one could pay. I find myself, once again, staring at treetops.

Pacific Rim is set seven years in the future, at a time of constant war. Massive monsters — kaiju — continue to rise up from Earth’s core and ravage the planet. To combat the threat, man has devised comparably gargantuan machines called Jaegers whose pilots stand, armored, on a platform in the cavity of all that hardware and operate the robots virtually. For practical purposes, these men and women — brothers, fathers and sons, lovers — are Jaegermeisters, and the movie, which del Toro and Travis Beacham wrote, never tires of splashing the screen with the aftershave-blue montages of one meister’s mind melding with the other.

The human story proceeds in several directions. An American meister named Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) comes out of very early retirement to fight for a multinational outfit called the Pan Pacific Defense Corps, whose commander is an Englishman and former pilot named Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba). It’s right about here, with the discovery of a name as stupid and amazing and amazingly Bible Belt porny as Stacker Pentecost, that you have to suppress the urge not to watch the rest of Pacific Rim on a knee. Raleigh winds up partnered with a Japanese woman named Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) and sparring with a macho pilot named Chuck Hansen (Robert Kazinsky).1

The baldness of the badness that surrounds a lot of the writing and performing of these characters is reminiscent of Paul Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers. Like Verhoeven, a Hollywood-friendly Dutchman, del Toro, who’s Mexican, appears to have had more compelling business to worry about than how people sound. But the nationalities aren’t entirely random. The film is nodding — hilariously, perfunctorily — to global movie-attendance conditions by having the two best Jaeger teams hail from China and Russia, which, according to a Screen Digest report, were 2011’s second- and seventh-largest non–North American box-office markets. (Japan was no. 1.) Del Toro scatters the movie all over the planet, in its metropolises, its waters, and beneath them. His nation-state placement happily makes concrete what’s been obvious for so long: Asia’s the new Coke.

There are some good bits with the del Toro regular Ron Perlman, as an oily operator selling kaiju parts on the black market. But the official comedy involves a pair of bickering PPDC scientists — an overcaffeinated American (Charlie Day) and a limping, most highly strung Brit (Burn Gorman) named Dr. Hermann Gottlieb — eager to discover what makes kaiju tick. It’s an achievement that calls for a kaiju brain, which Day’s character, a tattooed monster geek named Dr. Newton Geiszler, spends the movie trying to procure. Day is as funny as John Turturro is in the Transformers movies, playing a character who works as a broad outline within which he can try out a shtick. The skinny Gorman is even better. With his dark clothes, matted hair, and madman rictus, he’s like an SS commander outraged that no one’s following behind him. A friend mentioned that the two scientists are like the robots in Star Wars, and he’s right. They’re the custodial undercard in an Ernst Lubitsch comedy, too. But these two do so much shouting at each other that, by volume, they’re also Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby.

In Pacific Rim, when two pilots suit up and are shuttled into a Jaeger, the camera lingers over the gear long enough for you to appreciate precisely how battle-tested these machines are. You can see scuffs and rust and grease and dents. You see the wear and tear and surmise their use. You appreciate the details. They tell as descriptive a story as the creases on Brad Pitt’s or Judi Dench’s face. It’s a level of specificity that only the people at Pixar might care to top. With Pixar you expect that degree of granularity. Del Toro and his vast team didn’t have to bother. But the bother becomes an endearment. So does the attention to the staging of the battles between the kaiju and Jaegers.

The monsters have the dino-lizard quality you want. They don’t have the hair and slime you’d get from a Rick Baker or a Stan Winston. They have a clear, ferocious Godzilla-ness that feels both absolutely referential and perfectly apt. Kaiju can rip Jaegers apart with their talons or vomit sizzling nuclear acid on them and are indiscriminate and promiscuous enough to chase anything that moves, including adorable little girls. When kaiju and Jaegers go charging at each other in, say, an ocean or on the streets of some city, you feel a perverse tingle of amorality. You crave the destruction. You’re riled up by the shredding in Ramin Djawadi’s score — the guitar’s credited to Tom Morello, whose history with Rage Against the Machine speaks to the sympathy del Toro evidently feels for the monsters.

Pacific Rim is just as guilty of mass destruction and mega-budget clichés as Armageddon, the Transformers movies, and nearly every blockbuster to open in the last two summers. But del Toro doesn’t turn real-world disaster iconography into kitsch for our entertainment. This isn’t to say that the movie is free of politics. (With del Toro, you’re rarely far from them, actually.) The Jaeger, for instance, represents a less morally problematic alternative to drone warfare.

But del Toro’s work is more inspired than traumatic exploitation. He’s studied pop art and likes to reinterpret it. Del Toro has mentioned that he found inspiration in Goya’s 200-year-old blockbuster painting The Colossus. I wouldn’t put it past him also to have been thinking about Goya’s gruesome remake of Rubens’s Saturn Devouring His Son. (Maybe he already used that for Pan’s Labyrinth.) But watching the kaiju and the Jaegers go at each other inspires thoughts of a less passive masterpiece: the boxers in George Bellows’s Both Members of This Club, a painting whose bloody, monstrous boxers — one man white, the other black — are made to look at least twice as large as the spectators surrounding the ring.



Like other directors who don’t seem alive unless they’re working on a massive scale — George Lucas, Michael Bay, Peter Jackson — del Toro can sometimes stall beneath the weight of his undertaking. The nearly perfect polemical Grimm’s fairy tale of Pan’s Labyrinth got as carried away with itself as his two Hellboy films. But what separates del Toro from those other directors is the joy he imparts to you. It’s the joy of a filmmaker who’s never forgotten that movies can do everything. It can make a Stacker Pentecost pre-battle pep talk seem vaguely like Henry V‘s St. Crispin’s Day speech. It can keep you checking the skyline for imaginary dragons.

The lasting image of Pacific Rim features a kaiju clamping its talons into a Jaeger and suddenly growing wings and taking off. All that airborne tonnage drops your jaw and waters up your eyes. On one hand, it’s probably just somebody’s computer. On the other, it’s a miracle.",LCD_Doc1_Once-upon-a,Lekhaj Daggubati,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pacific Rim
192,LCD_Doc2_Whatever-it-is,"Whatever it is, Pacific Rim is almost certainly more than a movie. Its lengthy, frequent scenes of robot-versus-alien fist-slugging, head-crushing, and (literal) heart-wrenching fall somewhere on the spectrum—in scale, aesthetic sensibility, and intended effect—between video games and roller coasters. At certain points it feels as if you’re riding the movie, enduring it, suffering its blows and being buffeted around under its feet; at others, you have the impression of dealing the blows yourself. It’s surprising to hear that director Guillermo del Toro opposed the film’s post-conversion to 3D, since few recent movies have seemed so dissatisfied with the prospect of being confined to two paltry dimensions. Whether or not you watch the film through a pair of plastic glasses in a wraparound IMAX theater, Pacific Rim feels like it’s always struggling to break through the screen—if only to grab you by the scruff of the neck and drag you in. 

This urge to make the movies into something more than movies is nearly as old as the medium itself. It’s there in James Cameron’s relentless Aliens, the prototype for many subsequent extraterrestrial goo-and-steel-fests (including this one), and one of the first sci-fi-action films to treat the camera like a blunt instrument violently applied. It’s there in the short-lived SensurroundTM technology designed to make whole theaters playing the 1974 disaster movie Earthquake rumble in time with the action onscreen; in Harry Smith’s never-realized dream of showing his alchemical cut-out-animation epic Heaven and Earth Magic to audiences seated in chairs modeled after objects featured in the film, including watermelons and eggs; in Abel Gance’s triple-screen Napoleon. It’s even there in the oft-quoted legend surrounding the Lumière Brothers’ first public film screening: audiences leaping out of their seats to avoid being run down by an incoming onscreen train.

At its best moments, Pacific Rim summons up a kind of pummeling, headache-inducing rapture: metal fists tearing through steel like cotton candy; tiny humans staring down their own skyscraper-sized mechanical creations; towering figures eclipsing the sun and moon; sword-wielding robot and winged monster locked in an aerial fight to the death, looking like a technologically souped-up George and the dragon. If years of action movies copying one other have jaded us to the sight of enormous dinosaur-like aliens reducing suspended bridges to shreds, Pacific Rim’s opening shots might challenge our resolve. It’s a function both of the movie’s meticulous sense of visual detail and its superb sound design that, despite the evident use of CGI, those torn cables and plummeting cars feel possessed of real substance and weight—and the horned extraterrestrial tearing through them, triply so.





The extraterrestrial in question, we’re told in voiceover, has just emerged from a wormhole caused by a fissure in the earth’s tectonic plates (happily, further logistics are left to the viewer’s imagination). It’s the first in a long string of wonderfully designed aliens—all bulging eyes, neon tongues and gaping acid-spitting maws—to wreak havoc on major cities over the course of Pacific Rim’s just-over-two-hour runtime. To defend itself, the movie’s human population has created massive fighting machines operated by two pilots, who must in the process undergo a mind-meld known as a “neural handshake,” which would make a great name for a Seventies prog-rock band.

Pacific Rim is permanently calibrated to a 25-story-tall scale: when it’s in the air, in the streets, underground, or out at sea, it moves with grace and precision; when it stoops to a human level, sometimes it recalls the Stephin Merritt line that you can’t use a bulldozer to study orchids. In del Toro’s deft hands, scenes of brawling colossi take on a kind of delicate, meticulous order: at the end of one of the film’s best set-pieces, a robot forced back hundreds of feet mid-battle stops just short of the edge of a pier, sending a tiny, solitary bird flying away. Later, a metallic fist tearing in one split-second through several dozen rooms of an office building reaches its full length just in time to set a desktop Newton’s Cradle in gentle motion.

On the human front, there’s a nice-guy-heartthrob pilot with chiseled features and not much personality, a hot-headed-but-ultimately-decent heartthrob pilot with pretty much the same chiseled features, a military commander (Idris Elba) who spends most of the movie barking orders and looking haunted, a female rookie pilot with a tragic backstory and a drive for revenge, a caricatured mathematical genius (complete with hobble and cane) and a nerdy-but-in-a-cool-way biologist decked out in alien tats (Charlie Day of It’s Always Sunny fame). Then there’s a kendo sparring match straight out of The Matrix and its kung-fu forerunners, a cheer-inducing pre-battle speech with echoes of Independence Day (“Today, we are canceling the apocalypse!”), and a finale in which a bomb must be placed in the aliens’ lair/cavern/alternate dimension. All of which is fine. Pacific Rim wears its more formulaic elements with gusto, reverence and pride, and if its scenes of human interaction are necessarily clumsier than its scenes of mano-a-tentacle combat, well, yeah. (As an added bonus, there’s the pleasure of seeing Hellboy’s square-jawed Ron Perlman hamming it up as a velvet-suited, gold-shod dealer in black-market alien remains.) 





Here I have to make a confession: there’s always a part of me that’s left cold by even the most impressive CGI-driven blockbuster; a part that, faced with any vision of reality fantastically rebuilt, craves instead just to see reality faithfully recorded. There is, of course, a world of ontological difference between Pacific Rim and L'arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat, and I’m willing to admit that, in theory, one provokes a very different kind of awe from the other. In practice, though, I’m more tempted to say that exhilaration is exhilaration, awe is awe, and that it’s fair—if not necessarily productive—to compare the thrill of riding along with a blockbuster and that of watching a nineteenth-century documentary, a home movie, or, for that matter, any direct record of people in motion and time at work.

A couple of weeks ago, I spent an afternoon at New York’s venerable, temple-like Anthology Film Archives watching a program of mid-century shorts by the great self-taught American artist Joseph Cornell, all but one completely silent, many organized around the loosest of premises and composed of street footage shot on the fly. Cornell’s subjects—most of them children and young women—wander through a long-gone New York in an effervescent haze, their own vitality and that of the city itself contrasting sharply with the ominous, time-weathered objects around them (whether hanging in thrift store windows, lying in dustbins or stacked up in bookstalls).

The thrill I get from Cornell’s films is that of seeing life, or at least what feels like it, unfold in real time; the thrill of watching the past pick up a vigorous pulse. And for me, it will always trump the thrill of feeling as if I’ve just punched an alien or weathered a fifty-thousand-foot fall. The movies have always been good at delivering this second kind of thrill, and if films like Pacific Rim are any evidence, they’re getting better at it all the time. Still, there doesn’t seem to be much of a qualitative difference between their brand of vicarious alien-punching and that of the arcade or the amusement park (which is, incidentally, why I always find it a little strange to hear critics call movies “thrill rides” as a compliment). Whereas that first kind of thrill—the thrill of seeing a moment of lost time called back to light and life—is, it seems to me, reserved for the movies: not for movies as roller coasters or full-body sensory experiences or exercises in virtual reality, but for movies as movies, that is to say, as projections on a flat, unmoving surface. When it’s so pleasurable just to sit down and watch a movie that doesn’t try to leap out of the screen or tug you into it, I guess I don't see why I should need, expect, or want anything more. But that’s just me.",LCD_Doc2_Whatever-it-is,Lekhaj Daggubati,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pacific Rim
193,LCD_Doc3_If-I-were,"If I were nine years old, I would see the monsters-versus-robots adventure ""Pacific Rim"" 50 times. Because I'm in my forties and have two kids and two jobs, I'll have to be content with seeing it a couple more times in theaters and re-watching it on video.

Like George Lucas' original 1977 ""Star Wars"", Guillermo del Toro's sci-fi actioner uses high technology to pump up disreputable subject matter to Hollywood blockbuster levels. The film's main selling point is its overscaled action sequences. In a terrified futureworld, spindly-limbed, whale-sized beasts emerge from a Hellmouth on the ocean floor and duke it out with immense robots. The robots are run by two-pilot teams whose movements suggest tai chi exercises taking place on the world's largest, weirdest elliptical machines. They work in pairs because they use their minds and bodies to guide the machines in the way that puppeteers guide puppets, and the technology is too complex for a single brain to handle.

The creatures began attacking years before the start of the story proper (we get the history in a prologue). The humans can't fight the monsters by conventional military means because it causes too much collateral damage. They created the robots — called Jaegers — to engage them directly, before the creatures, called Kaiju, could make landfall. Over time the beasts have become bigger, nastier, more resourceful, as if they're evolving. And now they seem to be winning. Humankind is in retreat.

The fight scenes are often shot too close-in for my taste, and they go on too long, particularly during the final stretch — a problem that also afflicted""Iron Man 3,"" ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" ""Man of Steel"" and other recent summer films — and there are times when one of the combatants will use a weapon so devastating that you wonder why they didn't just haul it out at the start of the fight and make the punching, kicking and flipping unnecessary.

Nitpicks aside, though, the fights are astonishing. They split the difference between classical filmmaking and the blurrier, more chaotic modern style in a way that made me appreciate the virtues of both. Some of the whirling action has a geometric beauty that's faintly Cubist, and each fight contains surprises: a tactic you haven't seen yet, a power you didn't know about, a complication you didn't see coming.

But for all its mayhem, ""Pacific Rim"" is a film with more more emotion than its trailers could have led you to expect. The hero, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) is an ace pilot who gave up robot-piloting for coastal wall-building when his partner and older brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) died fighting a monster. The pilots don't just share physical responsibilities, they have unfettered access to one another's memories, and must struggle not just to control their thoughts during combat, but to avoid being thrown off when their co-pilot lets a distracting or traumatic image slip through.

Raleigh thinks the bond he had with his brother can never be replicated, that his loss was irreplaceable. He learns otherwise when he's paired with a young woman named Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), who lost her parents in a Tokyo monster attack many years earlier. The story of their burgeoning partnership is not just that of pilot/copilot, but brother/sister, or friend/friend (but not boyfriend/girlfriend, refreshingly). It's about learning to trust another person enough to allow their consciousness to fuse with yours.

The film contains many more examples of this sort of human dyad, including Mako and the robot fighters' commanding officer Stacker Penetcost (Idris Elba), who feels fatherly tenderness toward Mako and doesn't want her risking her life, and scientists Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman), who try to understand the kaiju's biology, and haggle over whether to use an intuitive or data-based approach. (""Numbers are as close as we come to the handwriting of God,"" Gottlieb says; he's right, but not as right as he thinks.)

The movie's action is physical, but it's also metaphorical. The metaphors are articulated with such storybook directness and unabashed sentiment that by the end, I found myself thinking about what it means to be in a relationship, be it comprised of siblings, coworkers, lovers, or parents and kids. These people are all just comic-book types, with ridiculous names and cliched back-stories. But their feelings are real. They feel pain. They dream.

""Pacific Rim"" stuffs each frame with multiple references to the latest iterations of what even geeks would call ""Geek Culture."" But for all his fanboy enthusiasm, Del Toro is also a man of taste—that's why he clothed Elba, the most dashing man alive, in a suit and tie rather than a standard sci-fi military general's uniform. There are the expected shout-outs to Godzilla pictures and such robot-driven anime as ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", plus hat-tips to George Lucas (in the opening section, the hero's older brother quotes Han Solo's ""Don't get cocky, kid""), and way too many borrowings from the shlocky ""Independence Day."" But there are also nods to Philip K. Dick, Ray Bradbury, Mary Shelley's original ""Frankenstein,"" ""2001,"" ""Brainstorm,"" ""Inception,"" and the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft, whose descriptions of demon-creatures must have informed this picture's effects. (Maybe now Del Toro will get to make his long-dreamed-of Lovecraft adaptation ""At the Mountains of Madness."")

There are many shots so striking that they could have served as the poster image: A Jaeger tumbling into an abyss, its E.T. heart pulsing; a little girl's red shoe in a grey ash-heap on a rubble-strewn street; a kaiju unfurling kite-like wings; a one-eyed kaiju-body-parts dealer named Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman) stalking through wreckage, his steel-tipped dress shoes jangling like cowboy spurs. A simple shot of Elba's character taking off a helmet is infused with such emotion, thanks to its placement in the story and the sunlight haloing the actor's head, that it would have made John Wayne cry.

Del Toro and his cowriter Travis Beacham have thought about how daily life, indeed consciousness itself, might change if something like this happened to the planet. There's a hilarious clip of a TV talk show during the overconfident period in which humans thought they'd defeated the beasts: the host teases a giant sea-beast puppet that looks like an ugly, melted Barney the Dinosaur. The names of significant machines and locations have a fairy-tale rightness: ""Shatterdome."" ""The Bone Slum."" ""Crimson Typhoon."" ""Trespasser."" The sea walls and cityscapes seem beaten down, jury-rigged, exhausted. This world existed long before you started looking at it.

A few hours after I saw ""Pacific Rim"" for the first time, I had objections to one aspect or another. Days later I can't remember most of them, and in the grand scheme, I don't believe they matter, any more than the ""flaws"" of ""Star Wars"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"" matter. ""Pacific Rim"" knows what sort of film it wishes to be; it is that film, and much more. In its clanking, crashing way, it's real science fiction, a play of ideas. It's earnest in its belief that all thinking beings are part of a hive mind, or could be. You see the notion acted out onscreen in teams of two or three, in military units and small businesses, in city populations and whole species. This movie made me think of a line from Roger Ebert's review of ""Dark City,"" which he described as ""a film to nourish us. Not a story so much as an experience, it is a triumph of art direction, set design, cinematography, special effects--and imagination.""",LCD_Doc3_If-I-were,Lekhaj Daggubati,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pacific Rim
194,LCD_Doc4_Pacific-Rim-is,"“Pacific Rim” is a big, lumbering, rock ’em, sock ’em mash-up of metallic heft and hyperbole, a noisy, overproduced disaster flick that sucks its characters and the audience down a vortex of garish visual effects and risibly cartoonish action.

And you know what? It’s not bad!

Leave it to Guillermo del Toro — that overgrown fanboy with a heart of gold and a mind of impressive philosophical complexity — to bring some sense and sensibility to this summer’s crop of dumb spectacles. “Pacific Rim” will never qualify as part of the director’s high-end oeuvre — “Pan’s Labyrinth,” it most decidedly ain’t. But as an example of del Toro’s abiding love for comic books, pop culture and movie genre excess, it ranks with his less intellectual but equally imaginative efforts, maybe somewhere between “Blade II” and the gloriously bodacious “Hellboy.”

In fact, “Hellboy’s” mordant star, Ron Perlman, shows up for a cameo in “Pacific Rim,” not sheathed in red leathery skin but his own, as a black marketeer working Hong Kong’s neon-noir byways. It’s in that port city, sometime in the future, that an apocalyptic invasion of sea creatures called Kaiju will or won’t be repelled by a ragtag army of Jaegers, 25-story robots that look like super-size versions of Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man, right down to the whirring mechanical hearts that glow in their tungsten-clad chests.

“Iron Man” isn’t the only movie “Pacific Rim” conjures in the course of its overlong running time. The central standoff between fantastical creatures bears echoes of “Mothra vs. Godzilla,” as well as the anime classics that del Toro has cited as inspirations. The visual design recalls “TRON,” some plot elements recall “Inception,” the crunching action recalls “Transformers” and the relationships recall “Top Gun,” wherein a group of cocky flyboys try to one-up each other in the name of saving the world.

At least that’s the initial vibe of “Pacific Rim,” which begins as brothers Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) and Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) suit up to inhabit their Jaeger, which is powered by two people who meld minds in order to create a unified consciousness, the better to smoothly manipulate their giant armored sheath and dispatch the voracious Kaiju.

But what begins as just another boys-and-their-toys smash-and-gab turns into something more, as del Toro expands the Jaeger universe into something far more balanced, even nuanced. The fantastic English actor Idris Elba gives “Pacific Rim” sex appeal and gravitas as the Jaegers’ commander, Stacker Pentecost, a titanic force and physical specimen himself. When Raleigh meets an ambitious, beautiful Jaeger pilot trainee named Mako (Rinko Kikuchi), “Pacific Rim” promises to introduce some welcome gender balance to the world of end-of-the-world heroics.

And del Toro, ever mindful of the exigencies of the genre, never succumbs to the humorlessness and over-plotting that has dragged down so many of his contemporaries this season: He keeps “Pacific Rim” firmly focused on its utterly absurd raison d’etre (Kill those Kaiju once and for all! You’re welcome, Hong Kong!). But he makes sure to leaven that mission with moments of humor, most often at the hands of two goofy Jaeger research scientists, played by the charmingly hapless Charlie Day and Burn Gorman, who proves the rare performer capable of channeling Jerry Lewis and Roddy McDowall simultaneously.

“Pacific Rim” isn’t nearly as visually rich as del Toro’s finest efforts: The ultimate showdown between the opposing behemoth forces is a murky soup of pulsating blue lights and writhing steel (as always, 3-D adds nothing to this enterprise), punctuated by dialogue clearly written in the belief that shouting something loudly enough makes it less ridiculous.

But “Pacific Rim” earns points for some terrific performances (Elba’s chief among them), maintaining consistently engaging momentum and for making the radical — if subtle — suggestion that empathy can be a bona fide superpower. That humanistic touch is pure del Toro, and it makes all the difference in “Pacific Rim,” whose own whirring, glowing heart doesn’t belong to any machine but to the director himself.

195,LCD_Doc5_The-simple_pleasures,"The simple pleasures of watching Godzilla or Ultraman doing battle on Saturday afternoon television have proved difficult to re-create since their heyday in the '70s and '80s. Big-budget Hollywood attempts to replicate the experience tend to not just be failures, but disastrous, highly polished failures on an epic scale: Roland Emmerich's 1998 take on Godzilla, for instance, or Michael Bay's Transformers series.

But director Guillermo del Toro knows that the charm in the clash of scale- or armor-plated titans isn't necessarily tied to the low budgets and laughable production design of those guilty-pleasure TV shows. And with Pacific Rim, he cracks the code.

It was probably only a matter of time before del Toro tackled this genre; his career, on the one hand, has been largely devoted to monsters of one kind or another, and their place as stand-ins for the things that scare us in the real world. Japanese movie monsters, on the other, were little more than atomic-age fears of mass destruction made flesh — made rubber suits, anyway.

In this modern-day update of the genre those monsters launched, del Toro and writer Travis Beacham trade in nuclear anxiety for more top-of-mind worries about climate change. The monstrous creatures rising from the deep in Pacific Rim are even assigned categories according to their size and power, mirroring those we give nowadays to hurricanes; a Category 4 beast can easily take out a major city, and a rarely seen Category 5 is a destructive force of nearly unimaginable proportions.



A speedy prologue wastes no time setting things up, which (thankfully) allows the movie to avoid the 2.5-hour-plus running times currently plaguing event movies at the multiplex. The Kaiju — this near-future society is pop-culture-savvy enough to have used Japanese movie-monster nomenclature for the creatures — come from an interdimensional portal on the ocean floor known as The Breach. And like rising sea levels, they've been taking out coastal cities. As the periodic appearances of these creatures have shown no signs of abating, humanity has banded together to create ""Jaegers"" — 25-story battlebots operated by dual pilots who must temporarily merge minds to drive the things.

Del Toro quite rightly declines to take any of this nearly as seriously as the characters in the movie do. For them, the war with the Kaiju, which is in its seventh year as the movie begins, isn't just life or death; it's life or worldwide apocalypse. But del Toro is making entertainment, and even though his battles rage at night amid gloomy seas, the movie doesn't share the grim, humorless tone of the summer's other would-be blockbusters.

So while Jaeger pilot Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) may be the dashing hero, his partner Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) the emotional core, and Jaeger Corps head honcho Stacker (Idris Elba) the authoritative father figure, it's Charlie Day, as Kaiju biologist Newton Geiszler, who best exemplifies what makes Pacific Rim work so well.

Geizler's scenes are funny — especially once he hooks up with the closest thing the movie has to a human villain, played by an actor whose big-reveal scene is too good to even mention him by name here. But they're not just comic relief; without Geiszler and his talents, the full plan of the resistance can't come to fruition. In making him so central, del Toro weaves together the film's light and dark aspects so that the proceedings can't be dominated by either.

He also keeps things limber with a steady stream of well-integrated cultural references. Early on, one pilot quotes Han Solo to another; one of the first shots of Hong Kong, where much of the movie's pivotal battles take place, suggests the look and feel of Blade Runner; Stacker's speech before the climactic showdown evokes the St. Crispin's Day monologue from Henry V. (He never says ""Once more unto the breach,"" from that play's other big soliloquy, but given how many times the film refers to The Breach elsewhere, he hardly needs to.)

As you'd expect in a del Toro film, the production design — particularly that of the monsters — is gorgeously detailed. It's a shame, then, that the only tired modern action trope the director falls victim to is the one that sometimes takes him too close to the action in battle sequences, making them a little confusing and blunting the impact of some of that design work.

Quibbles aside, Pacific Rim delivers plenty of the thing that's been lacking in this summer's event movies: fun. Monsters, robots, grand heroism and a few clever jokes: Sounds like a perfect Saturday afternoon to me.",LCD_Doc5_The-simple_pleasures,Lekhaj Daggubati,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pacific Rim
196,LCD_Doc6_Heading-into-the,"Heading into the summer, there was perhaps no Hollywood blockbuster that appeared to have as low a floor and as high a ceiling as Pacific Rim. On the one hand, the cast is notably second-tier and the plot--giant, human-operated robots fighting giant, alien sea monsters off the coast of Hong Kong--seems like a cross between Battleship and the Transformers movies. On the other hand, the movie is directed by Guillermo del Toro, whose prior achievements--both pop-cultural (Hellboy) and high-cultural (Pan's Labyrinth)--are beyond reproach. Adding weight on the negative side of the scale were a series of underwhelming trailers. But on the positive side, again: The movie is directed by Guillermo del Toro.

So now that Pacific Rim has landed ashore, which is it? A feebly written special-effects-fest explicitly engineered for the international market? Or a work of next-generation visual imagination? The answer, I fear, is both--though the balance tilts somewhat toward the former.

The story begins in the near-future, when an interstellar portal opens up deep in the Pacific Ocean and belches forth a lumbering monstrosity that lays waste to San Francisco. Though this ""Kaiju""--the term is a genial nod to the Japanese giant-monster movies of the 1950s and '60s--is ultimately defeated by the military, another materializes six months later, and then another, and another. Humankind quickly comes to the conclusion that (tagline alert) to fight monsters, we must create monsters of our own--specifically, towering mechanical men called ""Jaegers."" (The word is German for ""hunter."")

This arrangement works out nicely for several years, with the implicit contest between Japanese Godzilloids and German engineering consistently favoring the latter. But in 2020, the balance of power shifts as a new and more formidable species of Kaiju surfaces. Within five years, the Jaeger program is all but abandoned. Though a few brave robot-jockeys continue to fight the good fight, the program is largely mothballed, with the governments of the world instead investing in the construction of a giant ""Wall of Life"" intended to keep out the transgalactic interlopers. (Let's see: liberal filmmaker, border wall intended to keep out ""aliens""--I'll give you one guess how well this works.)

Let's begin with the good: Pacific Rim's visual effects are extraordinary, in particular an early Jaeger-Kaiju battle that takes place off the nighttime coast of Anchorage--an irresistibly kinetic and immersive churn of metal sinew and lizard flesh and sea foam. (Eat your heart out, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla.) The final half-hour or so of the film is similarly spectacular--more Jaegers fighting more Kaijus--even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of that initial confrontation.

The problem is pretty much everything that takes place in between. There are a few nice visual moments scattered here and there: a gag involving a Newton's cradle; a scene of workers sitting on the girders of the half-constructed Wall that recalls iconic Manhattan skyscraper photos; an introductory shot peeking under an umbrella in the rain that's reminiscent of a similar shot in Hellboy. But overall, the plotting is tedious, the characters drab, and the dialogue evidently contrived with the specific intent of losing nothing in the process of dubbing or subtitling. Indeed, almost every element of the film seems designed for a seamless translation to foreign audiences, and while in some areas this is not a bad thing (the international cast, the Hong Kong setting), for the most part the result is a bland narrative appeal to the lowest common denominator. The movie's visual achievements notwithstanding, Pacific Rim's greatest breakthrough may be that it's the first Hollywood blockbuster to sport a title less descriptive of its plot than of its intended market.

Charlie Hunnam (of Sons of Anarchy) stars as Generic Caucasian American Hero Jaeger pilot Raleigh Becket--yes, I know, but be forewarned that the names only get worse from here. In the early going, Raleigh is essentially indistinguishable from his brother/co-pilot Yancy (Homeland's Diego Klattenhoff), though the film solves this problem by killing the latter off about 10 minutes in. Raleigh's stiffly upper-lipped boss in the Jaeger program, played by Idris Elba with an uncharacteristic lack of charisma, is Stacker Pentecost (I told you!); and his eventual new co-pilot and budding love interest is Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi, of Babel). Rounding out the cast are Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as a mismatched pair of Kaiju researchers, and Ron Perlman as a black marketeer specializing in Kaiju organs.

Normally, when a film provides characters as underdeveloped as these, the solution is to spend a little more time letting us get to know them. But in Pacific Rim the problem is that we already spend far too much time getting to not-know them. Let's face it: We're here for the robots and monsters, and pretty much every minute--and there are many of them--that del Toro wastes on underfed romance, clunking stabs at grace, and awkwardly manufactured interpersonal conflict is a minute that we're not able to enjoy the Global Ultimate Fighting Championship, Behemoth Division.

It is worth noting here that a central element of the movie's plot is that a single human being cannot withstand the psychic strain of operating a Jaeger alone, so two pilots, latched into mechanical harnesses side by side within the massive robotic cranium, must get into one another's heads via ""neural bridge"" to operate the machine together. (Duos adept at such bonding are called ""drift compatible,"" which seems a phrase better-suited to surfing than to repelling alien invasions.) It's a hokey conceit--though many films have made do with worse--and del Toro does it no favors by larding it with metaphorical meaning. ""Either we get along or we die,"" he told The Boston Globe. ""The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.""

It's an admirable sentiment, I suppose, though one not much in evidence in the actual movie. Far from offering a melding of different types, the Jaeger teams generally seem an exercise in genetic overlap. Of the four crews we meet, one is made up of two brothers, another of father and son, and a third of two Russians sharing a last name (whether this denotes marriage or siblinghood is unclear); the only team featuring non-nuclear family is the one comprised of Hunnam and Kikuchi's characters, who are gradually (and unpersuasively) revealed to be proto-smooch-buddies.

In the end, this all-in-the-family ethos seems like yet another prong in the movie's international marketing strategy. We know all the usual panders: limit the comedy (which often doesn't translate), go wild with the explosions (which always do), and don't worry too much about the central plot. But Pacific Rim adds a new wrinkle with its constant recourse to familial motivations: a brother avenging his brother, a daughter avenging her parents, a surrogate dad protecting his surrogate daughter, an Aussie father-and-son team swapping sacrifices, a boy offering his life for the girl he loves, and on and on. Forget culture-specific incentives such as honor or glory, let alone motivations more complex: Here, it's all about defending the tribe, on levels micro and macro alike.

As noted, Pacific Rim is visually spectacular, and those curious should endeavor to see it on the large screen. But the film also serves as a cautionary tale of the compromises entailed in trying to be all things to all peoples.",LCD_Doc6_Heading-into-the,Lekhaj Daggubati,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pacific Rim
197,LCD_Doc7_The-Mexican-born,"The Mexican-born director Guillermo del Toro evinces so much passion when he talks about genre — horror, fantasy, and sci-fi in film and fiction — that it’s hard to believe he managed to get so little emotion into his giant-robots-versus-giant-monsters epic, Pacific Rim. The movie isn’t bad. It has a couple of exciting scenes (I can’t really remember them, but I remember being excited) and one actor with more preternatural force than the monsters. It’s just weirdly inexpressive. Pacific Rim (a flat title, though a good setup for the inevitable porn version) doesn’t even have the charm of such Toho beanbags as Destroy All Monsters, War of the Gargantuas, or the underappreciated King Kong Escapes — in which Kong battles “MechaKong,” the creation of the dastardly Dr. Who (not the TARDIS one). Pacific Rim made me marvel at the technology of movies, but never the magic of them.



I think Del Toro goes wrong from the first line of the voice-over narration, when the nominal hero, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), says he was 15 when the first kaiju (translation: giant f–king alien f—ing monster) emerged from a portal to another world in the middle of the sea. The story he goes on to tell — how Earth’s weapons were ineffectual and cities leveled, how scientists were finally able to design giant robots that had to be operated by mind-melded (pardon my Trekspeak) pilots — sounds as if it would make a fantastic movie. Imagine that first out-of-nowhere kaiju attack, the decisive failure of tanks and missiles, the frantic arms race as millions perish, the tragic mistakes (in which test pilots die horribly) before neuro-connectivity is achieved … Did I miss that movie? Or did Del Toro for reasons known only to him decide to make the overblown sequel first? It’s as if Michael Bay had skipped right to Transformers 2 without establishing his hero and giving us a baseline of normalcy.



After the aforementioned Pacific Rim 1 has been hastily synopsized, Pacific Rim 2 kicks off with an unprecedentedly deadly Pacific Rim expulsion. Whatever demon power is sending humongous whatzits up that subterranean canal, it has adapted to our killing techniques and modified its kaiju. Plus, it’s sending out two at time! Who knew it could do that? Could it possibly send three? Surely not. Raleigh and his brother, Yancy Becket (Diego Klattenhoff), are ace giant-robot (or jaeger) pilots, meaning they’re — all together now — jaegermeisters. But after they disobey orders to save a freighter, they get reamed.

Five years later, it looks bad for humankind but better for the movie with an uptick in screen time for boss-man Stacker Pentecost, played by Idris Elba. Forget The Wire, Luther, etc. If anything proves Elba is a major actor, it’s Pacific Rim. He can makes a ridiculously florid exhortation to his troops — “At the edge of our hope at the end of our time … ” — sound better than what Shakespeare offered Henry at Agincourt. Elba picks up this ten-ton barrel of silliness and carries it like Atlas on his back. In most films, scenes in which tight-ass superiors chastise maverick heroes for being mavericky are there to make the maverickness seem even more heroic. Elba makes you want to tell the mavericks to shut up and listen. He psychs Raleigh out and the audience, too. It’s a tragedy of cosmic proportions that he has no scenes with the movie’s only other good character, a mythically sleazy dealer in dead kaiju body parts called Hannibal Chau played by Ron Perlman. Perhaps their classic confrontation happened in Pacific Rim 1. In any case, Elba has little chemistry with the actors he does have scenes with — Hunnam and the little mangalike Japanese femme Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), who’s eager to suit up and boot up and avenge the death of her family. Mori is cute and game and is capable of registering more than one emotion at a time. As her scene partner, Hunnam doesn’t have a lot to work with. He’s a good actor, but he’s blandified.

Del Toro is one of those directors (Christopher Nolan remains the Lord and Savior) who brings out the fanboys, ever eager to defend him (even before seeing the film in question) from the slings and arrows of critics who just don’t get it. Perusing the web, I’ve found comments like this after negative reviews: “You should know what you’re signing up for when you buy a ticket to this movie. Its [sic] a monsters vs robots movie. In my eyes, that is just a fun, entertaining time. You don’t have to be an 11 year old boy to appreciate this. Anyone can like a [sic] robots and monsters engaging in a smackdown.” I agree! But anyone who can geek out to Pacific Rim is doing a lot of the movie’s work for it. The compositions are boxy and the battles clanky and spatially incoherent — shot up close for extra punch but with so little breathing room in the frame that you lose all sense of scale. I almost never knew who (or what) was bashing whom (or what).

The film is better when it’s not so fast and furious, as in shots of choppers carrying (and landing) the colossal robots or of creatures emerging from the sea and only gradually revealing their odd shapes and protuberances. Gigantitude prompts awe. The wittiest design is of a kaiju fetus that erupts from its mother’s womb — also the film’s most organic design. Otherwise, Del Toro’s feel for organic textures doesn’t come through in a movie made mostly inside computers. Pacific Rim is a puzzler. It’s as if Del Toro neuro-linked with a robot and then couldn’t figure out how to work the controls — and so watched impotently as the machine made the major creative decisions.",LCD_Doc7_The-Mexican-born,Lekhaj Daggubati,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pacific Rim
198,LCD_Doc8_Here-be-dragons,"Here be dragons. One day an unbelievably enormous monster, a bit like a dinosaur but as big as a skyscraper, rose from a breach in the earth's crust beneath the Pacific and attacked San Francisco. Six months later another slightly different Kaiju (Japanese for monster) appeared — and then they kept on coming, each one a little different and nastier.

To combat these monsters, mankind made monsters of its own — colossal robots called Jaegers (German for hunter), 25 storeys high, mainly dealing with the Kaiju by straightforward bashing with their massive fists. So immense and complex  are the Jaegers that two pilots are needed, strapped into suits in a compartment inside the head, Numbskull-style, communicating by a special mind-meld known as The Drift, only feasible if the pair already have a deep affinity. 

Our hero Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam) was a great Jaeger pilot with his older brother — until his bro was killed when they were distracted mid-combat with a sharky Kaiju called Knifehead. For five years, Raleigh has been laying low  (“I can’t have anybody else in my head again”).

Now there are only four Jaegers left, in the fortified ruins of Hong Kong, under the leadership of former pilot Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba).

Nearly all this exposition is delivered fast in the pre-title sequence. Thereafter  the movie’s main business is Jaeger-Kaiju fight sequences, titanic combats mainly at sea, murkily filmed (all the more so in the retrofitted 3D) and often hard to follow, all of it, of course, computer-generated by Industrial Light & Magic, powered along by a crashingly loud soundtrack.

The director, co-writer and co-producer Guillermo del Toro (Pan’s Labyrinth, Cronos and the two Hellboy films) has gone all out here to satisfy himself as a monster-loving fanboy. If you too love the whole Kaiju genre kicked off by Godzilla and what you want above all from a movie is  being able to gasp “Awesome!” repeatedly, Pacific Rim is going to be this summer’s delight for you. Promise. Kanye West has already judged it one of his favourite movies of all time.

If it’s human drama you like, though, you’ll be less richly served. Elba is at once charismatic and preposterous as Stacker Pentecost, intermittently dropping into a posh British accent, constantly wearing  a double-breasted suit apparently bequeathed him by Prince Charles. His Henry V-type rousing-to-battle speech is formulaic: “Today we are cancelling the apocalypse!” But then so is all the dialogue. “One way or another, we’re going to get this thing done!” our heroes proclaim, shouting to be heard over the crashing and smashing.

There’s a gamey subplot involving a villainous gangster called Hannibal Chau, who deals in Kaiju bodyparts, played by a man who looks like a monster himself (the most saurian jaw in the business), Del Toro regular Ron Perlman. And there’s some unfunny comedy provided by a pair of brilliant but nerdy and quarrelsome scientists searching for ways to defeat the monsters (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman, annoying).

Boys’ issues about living up to their dads are raised by a pair of Aussie father-son Jaeger pilots but there’s only one woman in this film — fanboys don’t like too many girls around compromising their missions. She is the requisite Asian martial arts babe Mako Mori (ultracute Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi, Oscar-nominated for her role in Babel).

Del Toro and his designers have created a great rustbuckety look for this film, all grungey and rundown after so many years of struggle with the monsters. It’s a pity, though, that the actual fight sequences should be so murky, perhaps because wa decision had been taken always to immerse the giant beasts in water and fog as a way of keeping some sense of scale (it may work better in 2D).  They’re often hard to read, making the walloping an aimless spectacle. But then again perhaps such opacity works, for if you’re not awed by the enormity of it all, you can suddenly see it shrink to that most traditional conflict: knights in armour, fighting dragons, again.",LCD_Doc8_Here-be-dragons,Lekhaj Daggubati,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pacific Rim

Enormous creatures have been let loose into the ocean from the earth's core by a tectonic-plate convulsion; they're lurching out of the surf and threatening famous buildings in countries all around the Pacific Rim from the US to the far east, and the only way to battle them is using gigantic automatons internally piloted by buff hotties working in pairs. It's monsters v robots.

But straight monster-on-robot action accounts for less of the film than you might hope, and the action is distended with all kinds of solemn character journeys, laugh-free comedy figures, lumbering set-pieces, tiresome sub-Christopher Nolan innerspace adventures, unzinging dialogue, and really little of the imaginative and visual flair that Del Toro has shown in the past. Only when Ron Perlman (star of the Hellboy films) shows up in a cameo do you remember that this is, at least notionally, a Guillermo del Toro movie. Perlman's muscular presence triggers a startling interest-spike, a sudden tang of flavour, and makes you realise that the rest of the time the humans, the monsters and the robots have all had one thing in common: a lack of personality.

The sea monsters are known by the Japanese term kaiju (strange beast), and the robots by the Germanic term jaegers (used here to mean ""hunter""). The film appears to emerge from a weirdly indeterminate cross-cultural sludge, a homogenised, vaguely imagined zone in which the monsters are, for me, bigger but blander than in the classic Japanese monster movies of old. In fact, the main jaeger here looks not unlike Emperor Zurg from Toy Story.

Charlie Hunnam plays Raleigh Becket, an experienced jaeger pilot who carries a terrible burden of trauma and guilt. His tough, careworn commander Stacker (Idris Elba) is exasperated with this troubled, young hothead, but knows his worth, and teams him up with a dynamic and beautiful Mako (Rinko Kikuchi). These two are hardly an obvious match from the military-Jaeger perspective, but their explosive chemistry might be just the thing to kick some kaiju ass. There are also two wacky boffins, Newton (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman), who go into a comedy routine perhaps intended to embarrass the kaiju into going away.

But it's not just a question of the two working in pairs at the controls. The point is that a pilot is expected to achieve a kind of mind-melded harmony with the robot to operate it, and because the resulting ""neural load"" is too onerous for just one person, he has to work with a partner and achieve ""drift"" with them too, intermeshing with the other's consciousness. So we get many internal glimpses of each jaeger pilot's mental world, and Inception-lite delving, which slows and hobbles the action-enjoyment without deepening it. Although I have to admit I found myself pondering the general application and thinking it might be interesting if, say, Group Captain Guy Gibson during the Dambusters raid in 1943 was required to ""drift"" with his Lancaster bomber and co-pilot Harold ""Micky"" Martin.

Pacific Rim cheekily disses Transformers in the opening scene – slightly ungracious treatment of a film franchise to which it is indebted. It could also have wanted to pre-emptively stamp its big metallic foot on the recent Hugh Jackman movie Real Steel, with a similar story about battling robots. That was pretty ropey, but in the light of Pacific Rim, it actually has a kind of unassuming modesty, and at least tried, in its way, to create real human sympathy.

That's not to say there isn't interest. The effects are ambitious, and one spectacular urban catastrophe wittily concludes with a collapsing wall nudging a Newton's cradle just hard enough to set it in motion. Yet smart touches like that are rare. I have been mixed about Del Toro in the past: enjoying the ferocity and bite of the Hellboy pictures and his Blade 2. I found the much-swooned over Pan's Labyrinth over-rated but it had a real inventiveness not obvious here. Maybe director and co-writer Del Toro took this job in a detached, impersonal spirit and it can't fully be considered one of his films in that authorial sense. At any rate, as a film genre, the big summer blockbuster toy tie-in spectacular remains untransformed.",LCD_Doc9_Go-big-or,Lekhaj Daggubati,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pacific Rim
